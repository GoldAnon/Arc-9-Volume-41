*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

Clind's teleport―― he described it as compression was something Petra had last experienced about a month ago, and Meili a few days prior.

Petra: [It might be surprising the first time, but there's no need to be afraid.]

With that, Petra, who had experience, gave the inexperienced Flam some advice.

She was concerned that if she did not properly inform her about what was about to happen, she might panic, but Flam shook her head with a "No",

Flam: [There is no need to worry, as most surprises cannot surpass those of the young master.]

???: [That guy, even his own camp treats him like a complete shocker. How crazy is that!]

Even "Subaru" was astonished by that overly straightforward comment.

However, Petra also knew from Subaru's memories shared via the Book of the Dead that Reinhard had blown up the building with a single swing of his sword and sent Meili's sister flying, so she understood Flam's unusually calm attitude.

???: [Even if Flam-chan is o~kay, I hope the sleeping Sensei-san doesn't wake u~p. Little crimson scorpion-chan was really panicked the first time Butler-san transported u~s.]

Petra: [That reminds me, is there such a thing as teleportation sickness? When we were in Vollachia, some people were fine with Spica-chan's teleportation, but others weren't.]

Meili shrugged, her hair rustling, and Little Crimson Scorpion peeked out from inside, raising its pincers as if to imitate its master.

The previous comment reminded her of Spica's teleport ability, who had been left behind in the Empire. ――Whether due to physical constitution, individual strength or weakness, those who were unable to deal with it were simply unable to do so. Petra was on the side of those who could handle it, but Garfiel was on the side of those who could not, and would curl up and sulk.

Then, in response to Petra's question, Clind raised a finger and said, “That is interesting. Consideration.“,

Clind: [Although the number of times it has been used and the number of people who have tried it are not that many, no one has fallen ill. Reassurance. Strictly speaking, the Authority of Tristitia is not teleportation, but rather the result of compressing the time and space that would normally be traveled. Abridgment.]

Meili: [I have no idea what that means, no matter how many times I hear i~t.]

“Subaru“: [So, does that mean it's okay to think of it like King Crimson? No, it's unclear whether it removes the middle part, so maybe it's different from King Crimson…]

Petra: [There's no need to worry about getting sick, and it gives us the power to create the precious time we need. Knowing that is good enough for now.]

Petra came to that conclusion, Meili looked puzzled, and “Subaru“ mused over it in his own way.

She could understand what “Subaru“ meant, but she felt it would be a waste of time and thought to dwell on that now. If she had the time, she would like to confirm all the memories and knowledge that had been poured into her mind and become someone who knew everything about Subaru――.

Petra: [Clind-niisama, can I ask you something?]

Far from fulfilling that desire, the time spent on it would be a waste, Petra prompted Clind.

The lens of his monocle glistened, and Clind nodded, “Yes, Timely.“ Considering the phenomenon he was about to bring about, his attitude was reassuringly calm.

Then, while Petra was admiring that, Meili pulled her sleeve with a “hey,”,

Meili: [Petra-chan, about the compensation we were talking about earl~ier.]

Petra: [―― It's okay, Clind-niisama said it was good.]

Meili: [That's not what I mea~nt. …I don't know the reason myself, but if you have to lose something, Petra-chan, then I don't like i~t.]

Petra: [Lose…]

Meili seemed overwhelmed by her emotions, and Petra blinked in surprise at her words.

Her friend's frank concern and Clind's assessment of the compensation she had offered-- the emotions that flooded Petra's heart at that moment were intensely complex and profound.

With that, Petra smiled at Meili and,

Petra: [Thank you, Meili-chan. But I'm really fine.]

Meili: […If that's a lie, you're terri~ble.]

At that poorly thought-out threat that had been mustered after some deliberation, Petra nodded.

She gently let go of her sleeve and held her hand close to her chest, then looked for "Subaru”. She knew his illusory form would not leave her behind, but it was a matter of principle.

When she spotted his translucent form, "Subaru" was gazing out in the distance at the Sand Sea.

“Subaru”: [If I had been a bit more careful, I wouldn't have caused you so much trouble.]

In the eastern sky―― where the very air cried out in agony, the sky turned a sickening hue, and the sound of the earth being gouged away echoed, there the battle between the Sword Saint and the Witch of Envy raged on.

It was a clash between two immensely powerful entities that would determine the fate of the world. Seeing "Subaru's" frustrated expression, watching as he lamented his own inadequacy, Petra was overcome with sadness.

Worried about his friend, Subaru did not mention the recent exchange between Petra and Clind, showing respect for Petra's wishes.

In essence, Petra could not hide anything from him, as he existed within her mind; if he wanted to, he could easily reveal all the information she had kept from him.

However, the imaginary Subaru did not do so. ――Whether this was due to "Subaru's" decency and thoughtfulness or because Petra's self-consciousness, affection, and memories were all muddled together, she could not tell.

However, regardless of which it was, this was what Petra thought.

Whether it was out of consideration or because it was what Petra desired, the way "Subaru" behaved was based on how Petra Leyte saw the real Natsuki Subaru.

With that in mind――,

Petra: [Clind-niisama, if you would be so kind.]

Clind: [――Understood. Commendation.]

Still feeling her love for “Subaru”, Petra gave the signal to Clind.

Petra, Meili, and Flam. With Patrasche pulling the dragon carriage, plus the unconscious Garfiel and Ezzo, there were six people in total. Add to that “Subaru” and Little Crimson Scorpion, and the group, with the help of Clind, began their journey.

To that end, Petra offered the compensation to Od Lagna――,

Petra: [――――]

In literally an instant, the world shifted, and the compression was finished.

When she closed her eyes and opened them again, the scenery had completely changed. The taste of the air on her tongue and skin and the smells of the world that touched her sense of smell had changed dramatically, and Petra realized the Authority had been used.

Petra: [――――]

For a moment, Petra closed her eyes and thought about running away.

However, she set aside her sentimentality with a momentary prayer, then focused her attention on the task at hand. From this point on, Petra and her companions could not afford even a single misstep.
 
Indeed, Petra gathered her resolve and――,

???: [Woah!? W-what's going on!? A dragon carriage just appeared out of nowhere!?]

???: [Is, is it Reinhard!? Only he could do something so ridiculous!]

???: [Am I dreaming? Toto! Toto! Lend me your soft lap!]

???: [Oh, be quiet! What's all the commotion… W-where did you come from!?]

Petra's enthusiasm was dampened by the noisy and unruly welcome they received at the compression destination.

“Subaru”: [Oh hey! Rom-jii is one thing, but Tonchinkan too!? Tonchinkan! Why are they with him!? How and <u>why</u>!?]

And, the final note to add was that Subaru was the first to respond to the warm welcome, expressing his surprise at such an unexpected turn of events.

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [Petra-chan! Meili! Are you both okay!]

Petra: [――Hk.]

"Subaru": [Emilia-tan…!]

As soon as Petra saw that change in expression and Emilia rushing towards them, Petra experienced sweet feelings erupting from within her heart.

Warm, fuzzy, and sentimental feelings filled her chest to the point it tingled, and her head was overflowing with flowery words praising her beauty and cuteness. Those powerful emotions were not just limited to her appearance, but extended to her mannerisms, her way of speaking, and even the sound of her footsteps.

Petra: [Too blatant…]

Petra's head reeled from the wave of easy-to-understand intense emotions that washed over her.

Up until now, the biggest influence of the Book of the Dead was undoubtedly the existence of Imaginary Subaru, but the shock caused by seeing Emilia was just as great.

Frankly speaking, an overdose of Emiliase might be life-threatening――,

Petra: [Why am I saying such stupid things? I…!]

Suddenly feeling as if half her consciousness were being taken away, Petra frantically grabbed at her collar, which she had nearly lost sight of, and managed to stay grounded in reality.

As expected, the love for Emilia was overflowing in an excessively bold manner.

That in itself made her feel a little jealous, but more than that, Petra was happy to see Emilia again. It bothered her that her feelings toward Emilia were being pushed aside by ones that were not her own, and she found that reality difficult to accept.

That was why, when Emilia found them and ran up to them with tears in her eyes, her face so beautiful it completely took Petra's breath away, Petra resisted the urge to spread her arms wide and think she was EMT.

And then――,

Petra: [Emilia-neetama…!]

Emilia: [Nee-tama?]

With a grand slip of the tongue, which startled Emilia just as they were about to have their emotional reunion.

She narrowly avoided calling her “Emilia-tan” and tried to correct herself, but missed the mark. It was a blunder that was very uncharacteristic of Petra.

Regardless――,

Emilia: [But, I'm glad… Both of you actually came.]

Petra: [Yes. I'm relieved that you are safe, Emilia-neesama.]

Overcome with emotion, Emilia embraced Petra, who replied and returned her embrace.

In contrast to Petra, Meili, who was also being hugged, reacted awkwardly, gasping, “I can't brea~the…” and timidly wrapped her arms around Emilia's back, returning the embrace as well.

"Subaru": [Woah! It's such a relief to see Emilia-tan safe and sound! Huh? Has she gotten even cuter since I last saw her? She's got so much potential!]

While he observed Emilia embracing Petra and Meili from various angles, the floating “Subaru” was overwhelmed with emotion. He was getting a bit too excited. But that was understandable.

After all, given the chronology of the Book of the Dead, the last time Subaru saw Emilia was when she was at her lowest point in the Sanctuary.

Back then, Petra had not been as close to Emilia as she was now, so she would not have been able to help her. If even Petra felt regretful about that now, then the frustration that “Subaru” experienced up close back then must have been incomparable.

"Subaru": [Oh! My goodness, Petra! Look! Emilia-tan is walking so energetically!]

Petra: [Yeah, she's walking with long strides. That's great.]

"Subaru": [I'm relieved…! I'm so relieved…!]

Because of that, Petra hesitated to pour cold water on Subaru's excitement. While responding appropriately to Subaru's strong enthusiasm, Petra quietly savored a sense of relief.

His relief was due to one thing―― seeing Emilia, which meant that there was no longer a reason to be afraid.

Petra: [The last thing I saw in the Book of the Dead…]

Trapped in the endless, obsessive shadows that surround them in the Sanctuary, Natsuki Subaru was caught in a web of inescapable torment, resorted to suicide as a means of escaping the Witch.

In that final moment, Subaru=Petra saw it. ――The terrifying Witch of Envy had the same face as the person he greatly cherished so much.

Petra: [――――]

When she tried to think more thoroughly about the reason, it was like she was trying to grasp something shrouded in mist, and nothing coherent came to mind. Still, the vivid emotions remained etched in her mind.

That was why she was apprehensive about seeing Emilia again. ――No, that was not quite right. To be precise, she was apprehensive that she might not be able to see Emilia in the same way as before.

Petra: [But I'm glad it didn't end up that way… Although I'm excited in a different way than before.]

Emilia: [Huh? Petra-chan, are you okay?]

Petra: [I'm fine. I'm just happy to see you, Emilia-neesama.]

Petra hid her inner conflict and was genuinely happy to be reunited with Emilia, who smiled with wide eyes. In place of Meili, who continued to be stubborn, the Little Crimson Scorpion on her head snapped its pincers, expressing happiness on its master’s behalf.

And then, there was――,

???: [――Just when I thought it was gettin’ lively, there's more of ya lil’ girls.]

There, a low, husky voice interrupted, and Emilia let out a gasp of surprise.

Emilia had left the door open when she rushed in, and a prominent figure standing there knocked on the door and peered inside.

That figure was――,

Emilia: [Felt-chan's grandfather!]

Emilia's eyes widened at the sight of the old man, Rom, who squeezed himself through the doorway. Hearing Emilia's voice, Rom gave an amused smile and stroked his bald head,

Rom: [The way ya say that makes it sound like ya really think we're related… Everyone here calls me Rom-jii. But, this is the first chance we’ve had ta talk properly.]

Emilia: [Um, well, I couldn't talk to you in the Royal castle on the day the Royal Selection began, and when Felt-chan stole my insignia, there was no time to calm down and talk…]

Meili: […You don't have to worry so much. He already understood the situation, so it's oka~y.]

Emilia greeted Rom-jii, and as she responded to his greeting, she looked down at Meili in her arms. Meili responded with an attitude that was half annoyed and half appreciative of the concern.

The exchange between the two at this point was related to Emilia's past interactions with Rom-jii. ――Meili was concerned because her sister Elsa had been involved in the incident where Felt stole Emilia's insignia, which was required to participate in the Royal Selection.

When one thought about it, these three people had quite a strange connection. If you included “Subaru,” it would be four people with a strange connection. If you also included Reinhard, there would be no end to it.

Rom: […Callin’ ya “lil’ girl” seems inappropriate given our current relationship. May I call ya Emilia?]

Emilia: [Yes, that's fine. Nice to see you again, Rom-jii.]

“Subaru“: [Wow… It feels like a historic moment, these two actually introducing themselves properly.]

Petra: [Don't be so dramatic!]

As Emilia and Rom-jii shook hands and exchanged pleasantries, Petra found it funny that Subaru would use such a grand word like “historic”.

While there was undoubtedly a sense of poignancy, the way he put it made it sound like he had witnessed the reunion of two people who had not seen each other in over ten years.

But, putting “Subaru's“ excitement aside for now――,

Emilia: [I've heard about Felt-chan, too. It must have been quite a difficult time for you and the others, right, Rom-jii?]

Rom: [Hmm, that's right. We should discuss that. Petra.]

Petra: [Yes. It will probably take a little while for Clind-niisama to return, so I think we can start without him… Time is of the essence.]

Petra added the last part, and Emilia and Rom-jii nodded deeply at the same time.

Yes, this was a race against time. That was why Petra and the others resorted to using unfair tactics.

――Currently, Petra and the others were gathered at the Royal Residence in the Royal Capital of Lugunica.

Among the Emilia camp, whose members were scattered and acting independently, her position was clear, and if anyone was to become the central rallying point, it could only be Emilia.

With that in mind, Petra hurried to the Royal Capital after meeting up with Rom and the others using Clind's compression, but――,

Rom: [It’s shockin’ ta see the state of destruction in the Royal Capital.]

Meili: [It's been a while since I've been to the Royal Capital, but when I last saw it, it wasn't so ruined, and there weren't any <u>works of art</u> like tha~t.]

Rom-jii said with his arms crossed, and Meili, who was looking out the window, joined in.

Unlike the two with prior experience, this was Petra's first time in the Royal Capital. Fortunately, the memory of the loot house she had just recalled was in the slums of the Royal Capital, so she was able to compare it with her memories of the Royal Capital in the past when it was still intact.

Certainly, the Royal Capital in her memory did not have many flashy ice towers, and the Noble District, with its rows of stately houses, was not in such disarray.

Rom: [I never liked that awful place, but I never thought Noble District would be completely destroyed like that. I heard that everyone was evacuated, but this is outrageous!]

Petra: [Meili-chan also said that Emilia-neesama made those ice towers, right?]

Emilia: [Ah, um, well, there was a reason I did that! Everyone was reaaally in danger, and I couldn't afford to hold back…]

Emilia frantically tried to explain the drastic changes to the Royal Capital that could be seen from the Royal Residence, which had barely escaped damage.

Petra found her frantic movements endearing, and worked with Rom-jii to sort out what had happened one thing at a time――,

Petra: [――So, as expected, Al-san did it.]

Emilia: […That's right. The city was thrown into chaos because I couldn't stop Al.]

Petra: [It's not your fault, Emilia-sama. If you hadn't created those ice towers, the people of the Royal Capital would have been in big trouble… That's why you're E.M.G. (Emilia-tan, Maji <u>Guardian Angel</u>)!]

Emilia: [Yeah, Petra-chan, thank you…huh? What did you just say?]

When Emilia blamed herself, Petra shook her head vigorously to deny that she was responsible.

Petra felt responsible for the devastation that struck the Royal Capital of Lugunica, especially since she had heard that Al and Volcanica were involved. She could not help but think that if Al's schemes had been stopped at their source in the Pleiades Watchtower, none of this would have happened.

Meili: [If you start talking like that, there will be no end to i~t. Each of us got outsmarted by Helmet-san at every st~ep. It was all Helmet-san and his group who were at fault, don't you thi~nk?]

Rom: [That's right. It's good to reflect on your shortcomings in order to make up for them, but regretting your lack of ability isn't productive. It's an old man's rule of thumb.]

Emilia: [――. Yeah, you're both right. Al did something bad, and he's the one who has to take responsibility for it. We don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves!]

Emilia's cheeks tightened at Meili and Rom-jii's words, and she regained her composure. Seeing Emilia's reaction, Petra let out a small sigh and braced herself.

As everyone said, pretending to reflect while being indecisive was unproductive. The path was always ahead.

“Subaru“: [Al must think the same way. …Otherwise, he wouldn't have crossed the <u>line</u> to break a Sin Archbishop out of prison. What in the world was he thinking?]

Subaru picked up on Petra's feelings and grimaced at Al's outrageous behavior in the Royal Capital.

In fact, it was an outrageous act of terrorism to use Volcanica to cause massive damage to the Royal Capital, but that pales in comparison to their real objective―― breaking Gluttony out of prison.

The Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, who held a deep connection to Petra and the others, had been allowed to escape.

Petra: [To list all the things that man has done is mind-boggling. He attacked those connected to the Royal Selection candidates and kidnapped one of their knights. He turned Volcanica, the Divine Dragon and protector of the Kingdom, against them and used the Witch of Envy to prevent the Sword Saint from taking action. Furthermore, he took one of the Royal Selection candidates hostage and invaded the Royal Capital, where he destroyed half of the Noble District and freed the imprisoned Sin Archbishop.]

“Subaru“: [Damn, isn't that something? How many years in prison would that get him?]

Petra: [It feels like I'm going to be executed at least a hundred times…]

Once again, the number and severity of Al's―― no, Al and his accomplices' crimes were extraordinary.

It seemed as if he was determined to do every bad thing in the world, but Petra believed that this was not just recklessness, but something based on a plan.

Yes, Al had a proper plan, and he was taking the necessary steps to achieve it, which just happened to be a series of crimes that were close to being the crime of the century.

Meili: [Maybe it would be better to reconsider a plan that required the involvement of Archbishop Sin in the first pla~ce?]

Emilia: [There's also the Witch of Envy, so there's no excuse…]

To begin with, Petra had no reason to make excuses on his behalf.

Based on the impression given by the “Book of the Dead,” Subaru considered Al to be someone from his hometown―― someone he did not necessarily dislike, but he clearly went way beyond what was forgivable.

In that regard, it would be fair to say that this was the shared opinion of everyone gathered here―― no, everyone involved, including those who are not here.

Petra: [Right now, Clind-niisama is going around to gather everyone else and bring Frederica-neesama and the others here. Emilia-neesama, where is Otto-san?]

Emilia: [――Ah! Um, about Otto-kun.]

Petra: [That reaction tells me everything. He's being reckless again.]

Emilia: [Ugh… Yeah, that's right. I'm sorry I couldn't stop him.]

Emilia slumped and looked down, ashamed of herself. But it was not her fault. If anyone was to blame, it was Otto, and in this case, he was not entirely at fault either.

Otto regularly acted recklessly among the camp members, and Petra, Frederica, and the others always told him to take a break, but this time the warning was not applicable.

This was because Otto was too reliable in this type of situation because he possessed the Divine Protection of the Soul of Language.

Petra: [Using insects and birds for reconnaissance and espionage? That Divine Protection sure has a lot of devious uses… But that means they will have to deal with that hardship in return.]

Meili: [A~ra, that's exactly right. Hat oniisan was always such a worry~er.]

Rom: [Despite my relatively long life, I have never heard of The Divine Protection of the Soul of Language. The fact that I have never heard of such a useful Divine Protection is probably because no one who has received it has lived long enough for people to know about it.]

Meili chuckled, but Petra agreed with Rom-jii's grim speculation.

It was true that overusing the Divine Protection of the Soul of Language was dangerous to one's health, and Petra had witnessed Otto, who had used it excessively in the Empire, start bleeding from his nose.

That too was necessary due to the demands of war, where there was no room for half measures.

Emilia: [He was worried about Subaru and the others, but he was especially concerned about Garfiel… He was reaaally determined to do something about it.]

Petra: [If Garf-san were awake, he would probably be down on himself, thinking, “Ottobro asked my amazin’ self to do this, and I messed it up…“. They're so alike.]

Meili: [Petra-chan, that was a surprisingly good impress~ion!]

Regardless of Emilia and Meili's surprised reactions, it was easy to imagine Otto and Garfiel wanting to do something reckless because of the situation.

Garfiel was still unconscious and had been left at Royal Capital's Medical Center, but care had to be taken to ensure that he would not blame himself or hurt himself once he regained consciousness.

Petra: [I hope Frufoo-chan will be able to keep Otto-san calm.]

With that, Petra worried about the well-being of the absent Otto.

No matter what kind of insect or animal he attempted to communicate with, Otto himself had to be present to interpret the information gathered. For this reason, Otto was tracking Al's gang alone―― or rather, with his long-time partner and beloved dragon, Frufoo.

“Subaru“: [Otto… I'm afraid he'll mess up at the crucial moment, and I don't know how much I can rely on him.]

Petra: [If Otto-san hears that, he'll probably be angrier than ever.]

Subaru tends to take everything on himself. Not just Otto, but anyone in the camp would be angry if they were told that, but Petra thought Otto would be the most frightening.

That said, it was true that Otto should not bear everything alone. If Clind could bring Ram along, they could share the burden with the help of her Clairvoyance.

And then, just as she thought that, Petra suddenly remembered.

Petra: [Hey, Emilia-neesama, I wanted to ask you something.]

Emilia: [Hm? What is it, Petra-chan?]

Petra: [I don't know if you've noticed, Emilia-neesama, but on the way here, Meili-chan and I suddenly felt unwell…]

The question Petra asked related to the events that took place just after Flam used the Divine Protection of Mindspeak with her sister Grassis to locate Rom-jii and the others, and decided to move on to the Royal Capital. --Suddenly, Petra's whole body became covered in goosebumps, and she was struck by an unsettling feeling.

Petra was so shocked that she wondered if it was a side effect of the Book of the Dead, or if Reinhard had lost and the Witch of Envy was coming for her, but Meili had the same feeling, so they concluded that it was neither.

Petra: [But, given the situation, right? Flam-chan and Old-man Rom were not affected, but Meili-chan, Clind-nii-sama, and I felt it. So, I thought it might not be entirely unrelated to Al-san… Emilia-neesama?]

It was an unusual situation that Meili and Clind were unable to come to a conclusion about.

When she saw Emilia's reaction, Petra stopped talking about the potentially sensitive information. Emilia was staring intently with her beautiful amethyst eyes, her cheeks stiff.
 
It was a reaction that showed she knew what she was talking about.

Emilia: […That reaaally creepy feeling is probably the work of the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony.]

"Subaru": […Did she say Gluttony?]

Meili: [Ug~h, it felt aw~ful.]

Subaru frowned at the mention of a Sin Archbishop, one of their most hated enemies, and Meili stuck out her tongue. Petra also put her hand on her chest and motioned to Emilia with her eyes to continue her story.

Emilia: [I'm not exactly sure what happened. But Al made Gluttony… Roy do something, and then I suddenly felt sick and my vision started spinning…]

Petra: [Al-san and Gluttony both got away?]

Emilia: [Yes, that's right.]

Emilia's shoulders slumped, and she nodded weakly.

In response to Emilia's reply, Petra glanced at Rom-jii, and the wise old man in charge of the Felt camp stroked his head with his large hand and said,

Rom: [When this was just about Petra and Meili, I was thinking it was just some kind of misunderstanding, but with Emilia feeling the same way on top of that, and Gluttony being involved, I don't have a good feeling about this.]

Petra: [What do we have in common…? We're all in Emilia-neesama's camp, maybe?]

Meili: [It would be easier to figure out if the fang onii-san was awake, or if the hat oniisan wasn't keeping quiet over there, or if Subaru oniisan hadn't been cap~tured.]

“Subaru“: [Including the current me, we're three idiots with bad <u>timing</u>…]

As Petra predicted, Al was involved, but the fact that Gluttony was also involved made the uncertainty surrounding the unknown attack even more dire. ――Leaving Spica behind in the empire was a bit of a mistake.

Spica, too, despite her many trials and tribulations, was one of the Sin Archbishops of Gluttony――,

Petra: [No, no, I shouldn't think like that. I'm not the Master.]

What could be done and what could not be done, what would be useful and what would not.

If one begins to determine a person's value from that perspective, one will quickly become like Roswaal. Insight could be honed as much as one liked, but it was essential to be cautious to avoid losing one's humanity.

Rom: [For now, let's just be aware of Gluttony's actions. So, according to your Internal Affairs Minister, their destination is…]

Emilia: [――Kararagi, the Grand Mogolade Geyser.]

Rom-jii attempted to change the direction of the conversation to move away from the inconclusive discussion, and Emilia picked up on his words.

That was Al and his accomplices' final destination, and the circumstances that led to this discovery were――,

Rom: [They took Felt, and she left behind a message for you guys. I trust Felt completely, but I'm unsure about you.]

Emilia: [You mean Otto-kun? I believe in him not just a hundred times, but a million times over.]

Petra: [Emilia-neesama, you are talking about numbers, but it's supposed to be a percentage. Still, it sounds cool.]

Emilia's answer, which is not bound by the concept of percentages, warmed Petra's heart, while Rom-jii and Meili looked on with amused smiles.

But Emilia answered Rom-jii's questions thoroughly, which was typical of her.

"Subaru": […You're not just cute, you've gotten incredibly strong, Emilia-tan.]

Subaru stared at Emilia with a look of wonder.

The fact that this "Subaru" was from the middle of solving the issues in the Sanctuary made it difficult for him to understand how Emilia had grown to become so amazing.

She wanted to tell him ――that the Emilia of today had been shaped together with Subaru.

Petra: [No, there's Beatrice-chan too, so it's a three-legged race… If that's the logic, then I want to join too, and Garf-san will get sulky if you don't include him. Meili-chan, what about you?]

Meili: [What are you talking a~bout? It's kind of weird when you suddenly start talking like Subaru onii-sa~n.]

“Subaru“: [That's definitely something I would say, but Meili seems to understand it a bit too well, don't you think?]

With a touch of lingering emotion, “Subaru” gave a wry smile at Petra and Meili's conversation.

Regardless, Rom-jii seemed to be satisfied with Emilia's answer, and it was shared that Al and his companions' final destination was the Grand Mogolade Geyser.

To be honest, she did not know what was in that place, but――,

Emilia: [Since we know where they are going, we should be able to get there first with Clind-san's help.]

Petra: [――. Right. Old-man Rom, are Tonchinkan-san and the others…]

Rom: [At present, everyone except the seriously injured should have entered the nearby town as instructed. …We cannot overuse the power of that Clind boy. We will adjust the plan accordingly.]

Rom-jii shrugged his broad shoulders, showing his understanding of Clind's Authority without asking for further explanation.

Thanks to the compensation offered by Petra, Clind's Authority to compress is no longer restricted. However, depending on the number of times it is used and the number of people involved, it will eventually become unusable. First, they will prepare a location with the minimum number of people and then decide on the maximum number of people to be deployed once they have assessed the situation.

Thanks to the reckless actions of Otto, a ray of hope appeared in the midst of the preparations.

Furthermore, the more information they had about what Al and his party planned to do before reaching their final destination, the better.

That was when――,

???: [――The means to accomplish those goals are already in our hands. Opportunity.]

Hearing that voice, Petra and the others turned around in unison. Clind, whom they had been waiting for, bowed, catching their full attention. It was exactly the person they had wanted to talk to.

Emilia brightened up and exclaimed, “Clind-san!” as if she had been waiting for the perfect moment,

Emilia: [Thank you for bringing Petra-chan and the others. Thanks to you, we were able to reunite properly.]

Clind: [I require no thanks. I returned to Mirula on my own accord, and it was Petra's support that enabled me to meet your expectations. Encouragement. More importantly, my apologies for returning late. Apology.]

Petra: [I don't think you are late, but did something happen? Clind-niisama?]

Clind slowly shook his head in apology, and Petra tilted her head in confusion.

Certainly, considering the nature of compression, it may be said that Clind took some time to arrive at the Royal Residence. However, there must have been a need to explain the situation to the other parties at the pick-up location, so it did not seem like something that would warrant an apology for being late.

Perhaps it was his perfectionism, a trait of someone who was good at his job. Thinking this, Petra looked at Clind, and he said, “No. Negative.“,

Clind: [As for the reason for the delay, rather than explaining it in words, it would be best to experience it firsthand, as this would be the quickest and most reliable way to understand. Personal experience.]

Subaru: [Firsthand?]

Petra: [Experience?]

Petra and Subaru tilted their heads at the unnatural choice of words used to explain his tardiness.

Emilia and Meili seemed to have the same question, and Rom-jii, who was in the most objective position, crossed his arms and watched with interest to see what would happen.

Then, as everyone watched, Clind moved to the side of the room's entrance,

???: [Ha! Kept you waiting, huh?]

With a dignified presence, a maid with pink hair strode boldly into the room with her shoulders back, her brash behavior perfectly suited to her―― it was none other than Ram.

When Clind retrieved her and they met up, she was wearing a maid outfit for the first time in a while, and Petra, who was also a maid, felt nostalgic for the uniform she also had not worn in a long time.

However――,

Emilia: [Ram, you’re…]

Emilia was about to run up and greet Ram in her maid uniform with a smile, but her words were cut off. She stopped in her tracks, and the hand that had been reaching out to take Ram's hand was pressed against her forehead.

Emilia: [Uh, um.]

Emilia emitted a confused-sounding voice.

Although she should have been worried about what had suddenly happened, Petra was unable to do so. This was because Petra, like Meili and Emilia, was racked by the same inexplicable feeling.

Petra: [This, is――]

The moment Petra saw Ram, she was overcome by an inexplicable, indescribable feeling of turmoil.

Petra felt an inexplicable sense of unease similar to the feeling of discomfort she had described earlier, which had been attributed to Gluttony. However, while she had felt strong malice in that previous instance, she did not feel anything of the sort this time.

This was not like that, but rather a different, stronger, more powerful attraction―― seeing Ram in a maid uniform brought out something intense from within.

And the answer to that attraction appeared immediately behind Ram.

It was――,

???: [――Sorry for being late to join you, Emilia-sama.]

With that, a blue-haired maid dressed in the same maid uniform as Ram stood beside her and performed a graceful curtsy.

Of course, it was a familiar face. However, as far as Petra knew, she was not in a position to perform with such perfect manners and wear a maid's uniform. ――No, that was not right either.

Once again, and again, and again, her perception changed.

No, that was not right. It was absurd to think that she lacked the knowledge and manners of a maid. After all, she was the first person in this world to show Natsuki Subaru and Petra, who was still a village girl at that time, what it meant to be a proper maid.

That attraction reminded Petra Leyte of this.

Namely, the one who stood there was――,

???: [Rem will do everything in my power to get back, that person… Subaru-kun.]

Yes, the Roswaal mansion's original versatile helpful maid, known for her polite but sharp tongue, Rem looked straight ahead with her pale blue eyes and declared so.
