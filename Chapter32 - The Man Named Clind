*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――While Aldebaran's party was being relentlessly pursued by powerful adversaries, there were two other places in the Kingdom where gruelling and fierce battles of equal intensity were being fought..

One battle was between the Sword Saint, who continuously sought to prevent the destruction of the world, and the Witch of Envy, who persistently sought to swallow up the Augria Sand Dunes after manifesting a part of herself from the sealed shrine.

Both the Witch of Envy and the Sword Saint possessed the power to instantly end any battle if they were facing any other opponent, but exactly because they were facing each other in battle, the fight remained evenly matched, and the outcome continued to be left undecided.

The battle would continue for a full seven days and seven nights. ――Bringing the grave cost of the world's destruction with it.

As for the other battle, distinct from both Aldebaran's party and the Sword Saint's, which, while it did not involve physical conflict, had the potential to influence the outcome of the other two battles greatly.

In other words, it was the struggle of those who were pursuing the “Following Star”, with Petra Leyte as the key.

――Petra knew very little about the man named Clind.

He was on her side. There was absolutely no doubt about that.

Annerose Miload, his master, was a shrewd little girl who was unfazed by her young age and the unfortunate blemish of being related to Roswaal. She was one of Emilia's strongest supporters and, even from Petra's perspective, was undoubtedly charmed by Emilia.

Clind, who dedicated himself to supporting Annerose and was trusted as a versatile all-purpose butler, had also given Petra lessons in etiquette and manners when she first started working as a maid.

Clind had not only educated Petra, but almost everyone associated with the Mathers household, including even Frederica and Ram, were taught by him the fundamentals of being a servant.

Therefore, Clind could be considered the point of origin for the servants of the Mathers household’s professionalism, and Petra should therefore be regarding him as a teacher or mentor.

However, it was none other than the person in question who had corrected Petra’s perception.

Clind: [I never intended to take on such a noble role as teaching and mentoring. Misinterpretation. I am merely conveying what I have heard from my predecessors. It is only because I have remained in this position for many years that I have had many opportunities to do so. Declination.]

Clind's way of thinking could have been interpreted as a sign of humility and modesty.

However, Petra intuitively sensed that these were Clind's true, albeit rarely expressed feelings.

???: [In the end, that man undervalues himself. Because he has such low self-esteem, he thinks his work is not worthy of any praise… He is being condescending!]

This was Frederica's unusually harsh critique directed solely at Clind. Still, Petra only partially agreed with Frederica's opinion; while she believed she was absolutely correct and the most wonderful person in the world, she was also in a partial disagreement with her.

At first glance, Clind's attitude indeed appeared to be that of a person with low self-esteem. However, Clind lacked the apparent hesitation or indecision when communicating with younger people or his junior colleagues, whereas a person with low self-esteem would tend to show more hesitation and indecision.

Clind's attitude displayed no such simple and mundane hesitation. ――Just like Petra.

Petra: [If I put my mind to it, I can do anything.]

Most people would probably dismiss such a statement as mere arrogance, but Petra did not care about most people; she only cared about those closest to her. And she believed that the people closest to her believed in her confidence and potential.

Petra was aware that she was full of potential and had the talent to bring it to fruition.

Not only was she cute, but she also possessed the talent necessary to walk her desired path and the determination to believe in that talent and continue striving toward her goals without ever stopping. She was fully aware that she had been blessed with numerous gifts worthy of heaven.

As someone who was blessed with such talent, she would say that Clind's attitude was not that of someone with low self-esteem, but rather the opposite.

Clind was well aware of his exceptional talents. However, he did not consider them something to be proud of. This made him appear modest and reserved at first glance.

Petra: [But, I really don't ike them.]

――Petra knew very little about the man named Clind.

However, Petra honestly did not like Clind, because she did not know him that well.

It was not unrelated to the fact that Frederica, who was always so polite and kind to everyone like a loving mother, showed a particularly special attitude and uncharacteristic expressiveness only toward Clind, and that she was able to discern his underlying emotions. Of course, it was also a factor that Clind had been acquainted with Roswaal for a very long time and appeared to be on very good terms with him.

But, the biggest reason derived from Clind's own nature, which differed from his relationships with Frederica and Roswaal.

――The main reason was that the way he conducted himself, which seemed as if he had already given up, was completely contrary to Petra's principles.

Petra: [――We’re back, so lend us a hand! I know you’re listening, Clind-san!]

As the dragon carriage passed through the gate at the entrance to Mirula, the town closest to the sand dunes, Petra raised her voice and called out to the familiar man.

It was all thanks to Patrasche, who had ceaselessly raced fiercely across the Sand Sea for a day and night from the Pleiades Watchtower, making it possible that Petra and the others were able to return in the shortest possible time and route. Even so, they were still lagging far behind Al, who had borrowed the wings of the Divine Dragon.

His strength was indispensable to catch up with that increasingly distant target.

Petra: [Clind-niisama!]

Petra pulled on the reins to stop the dragon carriage and raised her voice once more in the town square.

Petra's desperate plea was met with silence from the man she had just called out to. But, she was convinced that her voice had reached him, and she started glancing around herself.

???: [Huh? Where is everyone?]

As if echoing Petra's gaze, the imaginary Subaru spoke.

Just as the imaginary Subaru had said, even though it was midday, there was not a single soul to be seen in the square. ――No, it was not just the square. There was no sign of life in the entire town.

Mirula gave off the impression of a deserted roadside town, but even so, there should have been at least a hundred or two hundred residents living there. It was very much odd that there was not a single person to be seen anywhere.

???: […Maybe helmet-ojisan wiped everyone o~ut?]

"Subaru": [That's a scary thing to say! Don't act like Elsa!]

Petra: [Don't say such scary things, Meili-chan. ――Subaru, Meili-chan isn't like that anymore. It's because of her upbringing.]

The first half of her remark was for Meili; the second half, for the imaginary Subaru.

To say that Meili's worst-case scenario did not briefly cross her mind would have been a lie, but the possibility was able to be ruled out because the town was deserted but not damaged.

If Al had wreaked havoc with Volcanica, the town would have been completely wiped off the earth, and irreparable devastation would have ensued.

The appearance of the town was not so much a scene of devastation as much as it was――,

Petra: [It looks like they ran away in the night.]

"Subaru": [It’s like they ran away in the night.]

Then, the impressions of Petra and the imaginary Subaru unexpectedly overlapped.

Since Imaginary Subaru resided within Petra's mind, it was only natural that this would occur. However, as a young woman in love, she was secretly a little bit delighted that her thoughts were mirrored by her beloved.

Besides, there were other reasons why she was able to stay positive.

???: [――Although that may be a slight generalization, that assessment seems to be correct. Perspicacity.]

With that, a man stepped forward into the now completely deserted town square.

Amidst the bleak and desolate townscape, this person maintained a refined aura that stood out. Their mysterious presence was like a single drop of deep blue paint on a blank sheet of paper, exuding a subtle, unobtrusive yet powerful strength.

It was a natural talent so innate that made one think that even if this were not a deserted roadside town but the bustling Royal Capital or even a noisy, crowded summer fireworks festival, no one would be able to overlook the man’s presence..

"Subaru": [Wait a minute. I'm now loading information from Petra.]

Petra: [――Clind-niisama.]

"Subaru": [Aww, you beat me to it!]

When the unfamiliar figure appeared, the imaginary Subaru from the past looked a bit disappointed at being beaten to the punch, while Petra quickly jumped down from the driver's seat and looked directly at the newcomer.

The versatile butler, and the man who held the key to overturning this situation―― Clind.

Clind: [――. Considering the state of Mirula and the turbulence in the Sand Sea, it appears that it was the correct decision to abandon the return journey. Fortuitous.]

Adjusting the position of the monocle on his left eye by hand, Clind narrowed his eyes at the scene of the empty town, Petra, and the others behind them―― the murky, dull sky, and the cause of it all.

And then――,

Clind: [Petra, it appears we need to talk. Urgency.]

△▼△▼△▼△

Clind: [――I understand. Deliberation.]

After listening to a rough explanation, Clind touched his narrow jaw with his finger and closed one eye.

The sharp beauty of a thoughtful man was like a painting in itself, but unfortunately, Petra had no time to admire it, and her sensibilities lay elsewhere.

If she simply wanted to see a beautiful face, all she had to do was look in a mirror or at Emilia.

Clind: [What is the condition of Garfiel and the one called Ezzo? Verification.]

Meili: [I don't think you need to worry about either fanged onii-san or Sensei-san. fanged onii-san is really tou~gh, so I'm worried that he hasn't woken up yet, b~ut…]

Petra: [Yeah, I think Garf-san was probably protecting Ezzo-san.]

Continuing Meili's answer, Petra considered the two individuals lying in the dragon carriage.

Garfiel, whose durability is one of his strengths, suffered as much damage as Ezzo, a dwarf and magician, probably because he shielded Ezzo by standing in front of him when they were attacked by the Divine Dragon.

Without his heroic actions, Ezzo might not have survived.

“Subaru“: [So Garfiel took a direct hit from the Dragon? …I still can't quite wrap my head around the fact that he's willing to risk his life like that, even though he's only fourteen with a major case of chunibyo.]

Petra: [Well, Garf-san is fifteen now. By the way, I'm turning fourteen soon.]

“Subaru“: [Time just flies by. No wonder you've grown from a beautiful girl into a beautiful young woman, Petra.]

Petra: [――――]

Again, it had to be kept in mind that this is just the imaginary Subaru in Petra's mind, and not what the real Subaru would say. However, even if it were the real Subaru, he would say something like this, and she remembered hearing him say something similar before.

Even though she knew it was sincere and not flattery, the fact that he could say it so casually to anyone other than Emilia was somewhat troubling.

Regardless――,

Petra: [I'm worried about Garf-san and Sensei-san, but my biggest concern is Al-san. Clind-niisama feels the same way, that's why you waited for us, right?]

Clind: [The feeling is not quite the same. The reason I chose to remain in this place was because of a slight sense of unease I felt when I saw Petra and the others off. Misgivings.]

Petra: [A slight sense of unease?]

Clind: [Yes. Actually, I informed Subaru-sama and Beatrice-sama about it. Retrospective.]

Clind looked down gloomily at the information that Petra and Meili had not known. In fact, since the two who had been informed had both been taken by Al's hand, Clind's self-reproach must have been considerable.

Even the imaginary Subaru, who was unfamiliar with Clind, felt a twinge of sympathy for this unfortunate situation,

"Subaru": [Well, the more I hear about what happened, the more I think Beatrice and I did something wrong. I mean, Clind-san communicated everything properly, right? But we didn't say anything, did we? So, this is the result. It's only natural…]

Petra: [Subaru and Beatrice-chan aren't to blame. Subaru, keep quiet.]

“Subaru“: [My intentions are not reflected in my written apology!]

Subaru despaired as if he had struck something unreasonable, but Petra would not allow anyone to carelessly disparage Subaru, even if it was Subaru himself. Moreover, Beatrice would also be implicated with that remark. Beatrice was cute and kind, so she was not at fault.

Without hesitation, she dispenses harsh justice that would make anyone tremble. These are the rules of Petra Leyte's court, and the verdicts of Judge Petra.

Meili: [So, what was it that caught your attention, Butler-sa~n?]

Clind: [At that time, I was unable to make any specific observations. I lacked the resolve. However, now that the situation has developed this way …I feel that I have doubts about the circumstances. Concern.]

Prompted by Meili, Clind kept his eyes downcast and put his thoughts into words.

The “situation” that Clind found troubling probably referred to when he saw Petra and the others off at Mirula.

Clind: [It did not seem unnatural. Upon hearing the explanation, the choice of personnel seemed reasonable. ――However, it also felt like a combination that would require two or three difficult justifications to make sense. Intentional.]

Petra: [Intentional…]

When Clind gave his explanation, Petra chewed on those words.

To be honest, the fact that Clind was vague and avoided making a clear statement about the mistake in the selection of members to come with them to the Pleiades Watchtower ――had always nagged at Petra's conscience in the form of guilt-ridden speculation.

If Emilia, Ram, and Otto had gone with Subaru instead of Petra, things might not have turned out this way. Indeed, if Frederica had been there instead of Petra as initially planned, Al's terrible actions might have been prevented.

Meili was irreplaceable in breaking through the Augria Sand Dunes, and Garfiel was the camp's most dependable fighter as her escort. These two were essential members of the expedition.

Only Petra. Petra was the only member who was replaceable.

Petra: [――――]

Perhaps she should have been more assertive. Whether it was postponing the trip to the tower or everyone taking action together.

Of course, it was imperative to report immediately on our return from Vollachia on the events that had transpired there, and it was also true that Schult, who had lost his only support, needed emotional care. Given the necessity of making such sound judgments, there is no doubt that the current members were chosen for the right reasons.

However, Petra was not confident that her subjective, arbitrary wishes had not influenced these decisions.

Having been separated from Subaru for so long, Petra did not want to be apart from him even for a moment, and she was driven by a selfish desire to be useful to him. In a place where Emilia and Rem were not present, Petra hoped that her strength and presence would be able to support Subaru.

As a result, she did not even recognize the uneasiness that Clind had sensed――.

"Subaru": [――Petra, you're definitely overthinking this.]

Petra tightly gripped the hem of her skirt, and the intangible hand of the imaginary Subaru overlapped hers, and he whispered gently in her ear.

However, Petra was not easily comforted by Subaru's words.

"Subaru": [Well, I know it's not my place to say this, but it's not impossible that you had some non-zero amount of ulterior motives, like wanting to be with me. But that's not a bad thing. And even if you did feel that way, it was only a single percent. I know that the other ninety-nine percent was Petra's kindness that I know so well.]

Petra: [No… I'm just making the Subaru in my head say that…]

"Subaru": [If you say that, there's nothing I can say! That's like playing a banned card!]

It must have been embarrassing for him to say that he wanted to be with her, but Petra let out a long breath at the sight of the imaginary Subaru, blushing slightly as he pleaded with her.

To be honest, Petra hated herself for being so easily taken in by his kindness. She was not a cheap girl; it was just that Subaru's words were too powerful.

"Subaru": [Besides, I suspect that your suffering isn't really your fault, Petra.]

Petra: [Does …that have anything to do with Al-san being so strong?]

"Subaru": [Well, I've never actually seen Al fight with a sword, so I might be talking nonsense …but I do know Reinhard.]

Even though Al's abilities were unknown, he knew the abilities of Reinhard ――the pinnacle of this world.
 
Both Garfiel and Ezzo are incredibly skilled fighters who were out of Petra's class. Since Al defeated them, assuming that he is even stronger would be natural.

However, no matter how strong Al is, he was no match for Reinhard.

“Subaru": [When I first saw him in the loot house, I didn't really have an understanding of the norms of this world, so I was confused… But even by the standards of this world, he's still a beast.]

Petra: [Yeah. But Al-san also did something about Reinhard-san. There's no doubt that Flam-chan used her Divine Protection to summon him…]

“Subaru": [At the very least, he wasn't instantly killed by Reinhard. Even with an assist character like the Divine Dragon, that's not something anyone can do easily, right?]

Petra: [Is that related to why we were grouped up?]

“Subaru": [Maybe. But I feel like strength alone doesn't explain everything.]

Petra also carefully considered the implications of what the imaginary Subaru had said.

Indeed, no amount of strength mattered when facing Reinhard. With strength alone, it would be impossible to overcome Reinhard and achieve one's goal.

In other words, besides his strength, there were other reasons for Al's frightening nature.

“Subaru": [Honestly, things have been going too well for Al.]

Petra: [But, people who always seem to be lucky have other reasons besides luck, right?]

“Subaru": [Right.]

Although the heart of the matter remained unclear, Petra believed that it was worth remembering that point.

By having explored other possibilities, her feelings of guilt with nowhere to go were somewhat alleviated. Perhaps this was what Subaru had really wanted all along.

Meili: [Petra-chan? Are you okay? You're looking kind of spaced o~ut.]

Petra: [――. Sorry, Meili-chan, I'm fine. Anyway, Clind-niisama.]

Clind: [What is it? Confirmation.]

Petra: [I think your sense of unease is correct, Clind-niisama. I'm not exactly sure why, but if we don't understand that unease, no one will be able to stop Al-san.]

Clind: [――――]

Petra: [It's just us. We're the only ones who can stop Al-san. ――We have to stop him, then get Subaru and Beatrice-chan back.]

With her hand placed on her chest, Petra pleaded with Clind.

Building, building, then finally releasing that breath, it had taken considerable courage for Petra to do so.

"Subaru": [――――]

Imaginary Subaru stood with his arms crossed and stared at Petra's profile with a complicated expression. Without looking in his direction, Petra remained steadfast in her conclusion. She believed it with all her heart.

――Petra read Subaru's Book of the Dead. In the worst-case scenario, Al might have killed Subaru and Beatrice and erased them from the world. It would be natural to think so, given that Natsuki Subaru's Book of the Dead existed.

Petra: [But my Subaru isn't normal.]

“My” slipped out subconsciously, but it was true. The “isn’t normal“ part of it was true.

Natsuki Subaru had a power called Return by Death, an incredibly cruel and agonizing power that only a kind person could make use of properly. Petra surmised that the book she had read might have contained a record of one of Subaru's previous experiences of death.

That was because――,

Petra: [After what I saw in that book, did Subaru really manage to survive without dying even once?]

“Subaru“: [It feels like you have negative trust in me, huh. But, then again, with my impression of what Petra knows... all the Sin Archbishops coming up to bat at once, the adventure at the Pleiades Watchtower, the hell of the Vollachian Empire... for me to overcome all of that without a single mistake is, well, unbelievable even for me, isn't it?]

Petra: [Yeah…]

When Petra realized that Subaru's glorious achievements, which had already been considered remarkable given the hardships he had overcome, were, in fact, a collection of hellish trials far worse than she could have imagined, she was far from feeling disappointed  in Subaru, but rather, she felt heartbroken by that self-sacrifice.

And at the same time, she was aware of it. ――Of the depth of Subaru's emotional pain caused by Priscilla's death.

Subaru was so deeply, deeply hurt, more deeply than anyone could imagine. For precisely that reason, he had taken the blame upon himself and resolved to do anything for Al.

Al had betrayed not only those feelings of Subaru, but also his unparalleled resolve to “save everyone even if it means dying”, all of it. If he had killed Subaru and Beatrice, then even if Petra tore apart Al’s body, mind, and soul, she would be unable to fulfill her revenge.

Meili: [Petra-chan, Onii-san and Beatrice-chan a~re…]

Petra: [They are alive. Absolutely.]

Meili: […Yea~h. Both of them, especially Onii-san, are really tena~cious.]

Meili said quietly and gently rested her head on Petra's shoulder.

Even Meili, who was never so straightforward with her feelings, was genuinely concerned about Subaru and Beatrice. The fact that those around her felt the same way was a testament to Subaru's achievements thus far.

“Subaru“: [Whether it is Beatrice or Meili, what the hell did the me I don’t know about do?]

Even though they concern himself, Imaginary Subaru muttered in a bewildered tone regarding those unknown actions. Seeing Imaginary Subaru's expression, Petra relaxed her lips into a smile and turned back to Clind.

Petra had already conveyed her intentions and objectives. All that remained was to wait for his response.

Facing Petra's gaze directly, Clind quietly let out a sigh from his thin lips,

Clind: [Only you can do it, you say. What a bold statement. But your resolve is a sight to behold. Admiration.]

Petra: [――――]

Clind: [Frankly speaking, when the Witch emerged at the end of the world, bringing about a situation that only the Sword Saint could possibly stop, I had already half resigned myself to the fact that it was irreversible. Regret. However, if you are determined to fight on, then――]

Petra: [Hold on, Clind-niisama.]

Clind began to speak, but Petra interrupted him mid-sentence.

It was not because she thought the conversation would become lengthy or that she was concerned about digressing. ――To put it in Clind's words, it was a vague feeling that she could not clearly articulate. However, it was precisely because he regretted overlooking that vague feeling that Petra could not overlook it.

What caught Petra's attention was the way Clind said it.

Petra: [I said “we“. That includes you, Clind-niisama. Don't talk about it like you're not one of us.]

Clind: [That is… Hesitation.]

Petra: [Even though this might not be the right time, I will say it. Clind-niisama, you've always acted like you're an outsider when you're with us. I don't like that.]

She could understand if he is taking that stance as an adult, as someone who needs to maintain his position, and interacting with Petra and the Emilia camp.

But Clind is different. He treats everyone the same.

The the same was true for Annerose, whom Clind admired most; Roswaal, who had a frenemy-like relationship with Clind; and Frederica, who could not bring herself to cut Clind out of her life.

Petra: [That kind of lifestyle would never be tolerated in Emilia-neesama's ideal kingdom.]

Clind: [――――]

Petra: [This isn't someone else's problem. If you're alive, meeting people, talking to them, spending time with them, then the good and bad things that happen are all part of it. You can't just pick and choose the good bits and try to cheat your way out of it.]

Meili: [Petra-chan…]

Petra: [If you keep doing that, eventually everyone important to you will turn their backs on you!]

Having felt Meili's presence touching her sleeve, Petra spoke so strongly that she was out of breath.

Halfway through, she was no longer sure if she was able to express what she wanted to say, or if she had successfully conveyed her message. She wanted to say that she was probably influenced by the Subaru from the Book of the Dead.

“Subaru “: [Oi, oi, aren't I part of the cheat you were just talking about?]

The imaginary Subaru with lowered eyebrows spoke, but she consciously ignored him. What was more important was Clind's reaction――,

Clind: [Everyone important to me turning their back on me… Keen realization.]

When Clind muttered that, Petra gasped softly.

This was because the poignant emotions contained within Clind's low voice struck a chord deep within her heart. But more than that, it was Clind's expression that caused her to feel this way.

Petra: [――――]

Clind rarely showed his emotions. Petra could not think of any instances where he smiled, became angry, or appeared sad; Clind simply expressed everything with a blank expression.

There was a change in Clind's expression. ――One of deep sorrow.

A pained voice and a sorrowful expression. When the two overlap, people would describe it as ephemeral.

At that moment, Clind had a fragile and sad expression, as if reminiscing about the past.

Clind: [That, has already happened. Nostalgia.]

Petra: [Clind-niisama.]

Clind: [I have already had everything turned away from me before, Petra. Self-deprecation.]

When she heard those words, Petra felt ashamed, remembering what she had said just before.

With arrogance, she spoke grandly, as if she knew everything, about feelings she had only just begun to grasp. Clind already knew those feelings, and was acting with that awareness.

However, despite feeling ashamed, Petra still wanted to say something.

Petra: [Even so…]

Clind: [――Yes, even so. Admiration.]

Petra: [Huh?]

Clind: [Once in my life, I let go of everything. Even though I was left empty, there were things I discovered and accumulated along the path I walked afterwards. Reflection. ――Petra, my relationship with you and everyone else has been one of those things. Divine revelation.]

After he said that, Clind closed his eyes and looked to the sky.

What did he see in that sky, where scattered clouds were being torn apart, as if barely holding back the end of the world on the other side?

Clind: [Why did I stay here, even though I was not ordered to, just because of some slight feeling of unease? I suppose it was because I, too, found it unbearable to let things continue like this. Free of mind.]

Petra: [Um… Clind-san, would that mean,]

Meili: [That would mean, it is like Petra-chan said, and you are apolo~gizing?]

Petra: [Meili-chan!]

“Subaru“: [Whoa, Meili-paisen, said it]

Petra was confused, and Meili's clear response surprised her. Next to Petra, who was staring wide-eyed, Subaru called Meili “Paisen” in an admiring tone, and even though she had no memory of him doing that, she thought it was a typical reaction for Subaru.

Unconcerned by Petra's confusion, Clind let out a small laugh,

Clind: [My apologies for causing you anxiety due to my lack of awareness. Sincerest apologies. That said, Petra, I am deeply appreciative of you. Debt of gratitude. ――I, too, would like to contribute positively.]

Petra: [Clind-niisama…]

After saying that, Clind bowed respectfully, and Petra's eyes lit up.

However, as if to dampen Petra's excitement, Meili interjected, “I mean,”

Meili: [I don't think Butler-san had any intention of interfering with us or refusing to help, right? Petra-chan, you're just overthinking things, aren't you?]

Petra: [That, that may be true, but…]

Clind: [No, that is not right, Meili. Correction. To have a sense of responsibility means that I will take the initiative in proposing solutions. That is very different from being a bystander. Another self.]

“Subaru“: [That's a bit of an exaggeration to say it's someone else!]

Petra: [But we can expect that much, right? Then! Clind-niisama, use your mysterious power so we can rejoin everyone…]

Petra eagerly leaned forward, determined to make full use of Clind's power.

In fact, what Petra was counting on most in this situation was Clind's ability to teleport. His teleportation, which instantly removed the distance that separated them from their destination, was an indispensable power for chasing after Al, who headed somewhere with the Divine Dragon in tow.

Al's destination was unknown, but the very conspicuous Divine Dragon accompanied him.

Emilia, Ram, and the others, and to be honest, even the disliked Roswaal, but with their cooperation, it should be possible to determine their destination and catch up with them.
 
And so Petra charged forward with enthusiasm, but――,

Clind: [Unfortunately, my ability to teleport is not unrestricted. In fact, it is a rather inflexible power in the sense that it has limitations. Unfortunate.]

Petra: [Clind-niisama, you liar! Traitor!]

“Subaru“: [Don't get my hopes up! Clind-niisama, you're giving us false expectations!]

Meili: [P-Petra-chan, you're being too ha~rsh. I don't think Butler-san meant any har~m.]

The glimmer of hope suddenly disappeared, and Petra and the imaginary Subaru were angry. Only a fraction of their anger reached Clind and Meili, but it was still a false hope.

In the first place, it was a power whose mechanism was unknown, but when his teleport, which they had been counting on, became unusable, all that was left was a handsome guy, optimistically coming with them.

Clind: [It is not exactly teleportation, but rather a compression of time and space. Explanation. The distance that would typically be traveled and the time required are compressed. However, because this could have a significant impact on the world, it requires Od Lagna to turn a blind eye. Expedience.]

“Subaru“: [Od Lagna? What's that?]

Petra: [According to Subaru's knowledge, it's like an unconscious god, and the root of mana and such… probably.]

While Petra explained the unexpected word Clind had uttered to the imaginary Subaru, who tilted his head in confusion, she herself was not entirely sure she understood either.

Petra, who has been studying magic under Roswaal, had received a general explanation about Od Lagna, but she was not sure if she understood it properly. Roswaal also said that he could not fully understand Od Lagna.

However, Od Lagna is an incredibly large concentration of power, and in a sense, it stood apart from even the most powerful beings, such as the Sword Saint, the Divine Dragon, and the Witch of Envy.

Meili: [So, what happens with Od Lagna if you can't fool i~t?]

Clind: [Unknown. The fact that it is unknown is terrifying. Shock.]

In response to Meili's question, Clind slowly shook his head.

His answer did not seem deceptive or evasive. In other words, despite appearing to know everything, Clind shared Roswaal's perspective.

But if that was the case――,

Petra: [Clind-niisama, haven't you done it several times before? That means you were able to deceive Od Lagna… What should we do?]

Clind: [Petra…]

Petra: [You were able to use your power because you had a method. What do you need, Clind-niisama? …For example, mana is needed to use magic. A contract is necessary to control spirits. So, do you need to compensate Od Lagna to do this?]

Clind: [――. You are truly such a surprising child. Admiration.]

Clind's reaction confirmed Petra's suspicions.

In other words, by offering compensation to Od Lagna, they can obtain permission to use Clind's extraordinary power. Or, in Clind's words, to turn a blind eye.

“Subaru“: [So it's all about bribes and kickbacks. … is it a corrupt materialist, despite being a God?]

Petra wholeheartedly agreed with the sour-faced imaginary Subaru. But on the other hand, she felt that a God who demanded something in return was more trustworthy than a God who gave freely without asking for anything in return.

Above all, Petra knew all too well that the world was not set to easy mode where you could just get what you wanted without making any sacrifices.

That was why――,

Petra: [Please tell me what you need, Clind-niisama. I will do whatever it takes, no matter what it is. I'll do it for Subaru, Beatrice-chan, and everyone else.]

Meili: [Ar~a, Petra-chan, you're being sil~ly. You just said it yourself, but it's not “I,“ it's “we.“.]

Petra: [――. Sorry, sorry. Thanks, though.]

Meili smiled at Petra, who embraced her with resolved determination.

Looking back, she never imagined that she would have this kind of relationship with Meili. When Meili was imprisoned in the mansion, Petra often visited her because she wanted to bond with her and keep her from becoming a dangerous person.
