*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

???: [――Possibility is the compensation.]

After confirming what she had been told, Petra furrowed her well-shaped eyebrows.

Possibility, that is the price to be paid in exchange to use Clind's mysterious teleportation power. For example, she had imagined an obvious price such as an enormous amount of mana or a rare Magic Crystals, however――,

???: [What does 'possibility' mean in terms of compensation?]

The imaginary Subaru, who shared Petra's uncertainty, vigorously shook his head. Taking advantage of his intangible nature, he spun around in midair, expressing his dissatisfaction with Clind's explanation.

However, only Petra could see how charming he was.

“Subaru“: [Wait, didn't he say he had the Witch Factor of Tristitia? He did, right? Witch Factor is one of those sketchy <u>keywords</u> Echidna had mentioned!]

Petra: […I don't think very highly of that Witch of Greed woman, so I don't know how much I can trust her.]

“Subaru“: [Well, yeah, she's the <u>type</u> who easily causes misunderstandings. I don't particularly trust her, but when you think about it as a sign of poor interpersonal skills, I guess it puts things in a different light. She's definitely a bad person. No doubt about it.]

Petra: [Right. My <u>handkerchief</u>… Never mind.]

Noticing something other than the payment, Petra averted her eyes from the emotionally charged speech of the imaginary Subaru.

The tragic scene Petra witnessed while reading the Book of the Dead, the method the Witch had prepared, and Subaru, who made the decision to end it, were not something she wanted to talk about. She did not want to look at it, but she also could not look away. It was a troublesome thing.

Regardless――,

???: [Witch Factor, does that mean Butler-san is also a Sin Archbisho~p?]

Meili, who was somewhat naive and oblivious to the topic's sensitive nature, cut right to the heart of the matter.

That term was unfamiliar to Petra before she read the Book of the Dead, but Meili had somehow learned about Witch Factors somewhere. Petra felt she had to ask about Witch Factors, Witches ――and their connection to the Sin Archbishops.

Honestly――,

"Subaru": [If Clind-san is a Sin Archbishop like Petelgeuse, then how much of the peaceful discussion we had earlier can we trust…]

Petra: [You say that, but wasn't it Subaru who forgave Spica-chan, the Archbishop of Gluttony?]

"Subaru": [What are you talking about! There's no way I'd forgive Gluttony for what they did to Rem!]

Petra: […Maybe you should take a little bit and look at my recent memories.]

Like his relationship with Beatrice, the version of Subaru that Petra saw in the Book of the Dead has a very different set of knowledge and relationships from the current one. Thinking back, Petra sometimes remembered Subaru saying bad things about Echidna, so she speculates that there must have been something going on between Subaru and Echidna that she was unaware of.

Without a doubt, she was a terrible woman, so Petra's instincts were right. ――While this internal debate raged, Petra and Meili kept a close eye on Clind.

She believed Clind was not a bad person and understood that there was a precedent with Spica, who had once been the Sin Archbishop. However, that did not mean she would blindly trust someone like Emilia. Emilia's innocence was charming and endearing, and she hoped she would continue to grow up that way.

Clind: [Meili's suspicions are natural, but I am not a Sin Archbishop. Denial. To begin with, the Witch Factor of Tristitia is an exceptional case. Gap in numbers. Even if one is compatible with this factor, they will not be added to the Witches or Sin Archbishops. Ostracized.]

Petra: [――――]

Clind: [The previous holder… who was compatible with the Witch Factor of Tristitia, called himself the Warlock of Tristitia. Self-proclaimed. …No, it was a name given to him by others. He was not particular about what he was called; his wife simply thought it was a fitting name. Pet name.]

Petra: [Warlock…]

“Subaru“: [Not a witch, but a Warlock! Makes sense. Was worried if they called him a Man-Witch or something like that.]

The imaginary Subaru snapped his fingers in admiration as if they were in tune with each other. Meanwhile, Petra muttered a word under her breath and looked at Clind.

If that explanation were applied to Clind,

Petra: [So, does that mean you're the Warlock of Tristitia as well, Clind-niisama?]

Clind: [No. Denial. I am not compatible with the Witch Factor of Tristitia. Therefore, compensation is required to bring forth the Authority of Tristitia. Incompatible. Those who are compatible with their Witch Factor are not required to pay compensation to exercise their Authority. It is their right, acknowledged by Od Lagna, to rewrite the world. Formal.]

Meili: [The right to rewrite the world, hu~h? I've heard that a lot, but I wish Od Lagna had been a little more selective about who that is given t~o.]

“Subaru“: [I agree with Meili.]

Meili looked dissatisfied, with her lips pursed. As the imaginary Subaru stroked her head with his intangible hand, Petra put her finger to her lips and organized her thoughts.

She wanted to believe that Clind was neither the Sin Archbishop nor a Warlock. ――She also accepted the rule that those who were not compatible with their Witch Factor had to pay a price to use the special power that it supposedly granted, which was otherwise freely available to those who were compatible.

So, if the payment for Clind's compression as opposed to teleport was,

Petra: [For example, if someone… like me could use Clind-niisama's Witch Factor, would we be able to teleport as much as we want without paying any compensation?]

“Subaru“: [Petra! That's way too dangerous, don't do it!]

Petra: [Why? Subaru, you of all people should know! Your Return by Death is definitely the same thing as that Witch Factor Clind-niisama was talking about!]

"Subaru": [That’s…]

Struck with a realization, the imaginary Subaru fell silent with a bitter expression.

During the tea party with Echidna, Subaru learned that he had absorbed a Witch Factor――at that time, it was said to be from the Sin Archbishop of Sloth, whom he had just defeated, but considering the Witch of Envy's obsession with Subaru, it was probably more than that.

Return by Death was clearly not magic, sorcery, or Curse Arts ――but rather a completely different power, most likely an Authority. If that were the case, then Natsuki Subaru would also be a Warlock.

Petra: [If that's the case, then I'll become a Witch. I won't be afraid if I'm with Subaru.]

"Subaru": […Maybe that was jumping to conclusions. Maybe my Return by Death has nothing to do with an Authority or anything like that. Maybe it's just one of those typical gifts from an unseen God that always appear in stories about other worlds, it's a common <u>pattern</u> in stories like that.]

Petra: [You're good at keeping secrets, but you're not very good at lying, Subaru.]

With that in mind, he was trying to avoid any issues by keeping things hidden and avoiding discussions.

Petra closed her eyes, cherishing the kindness of the person she loved, then looked back at Clind. Clind's eyes widened slightly, and his face seemed impressed by her gaze and strength of will, but――,

Clind: [Unfortunately, that approach cannot be considered. Rejected.]

Petra: [――Hk, Why!]

Clind: [First of all, it is impossible for you to be compatible with the Witch Factor of Tristitia. And then there is the factor of Vanagloria, which is missing… No, it should be considered an exception. They are exceptional factors, compatible only with two individuals– the Hero and the Saintess. Specially tuned. They are not compatible with anyone else, in addition,]

Petra: […In addition?]

Clind: [Even those who are compatible could not escape the corruption of the soul. Shame.]

Clind lowered his eyes and pursed his lips. Petra sensed from his reaction that he knew the two compatible individuals―― the Hero and the Saintess. More specifically, he knew that the Hero was the only compatible individual with the Witch Factor of Tristitia and that the Warlock of Tristitia had become spiritually corrupted.
 
And the fact that Clind possessed the Warlock's Witch Factor meant that the Hero was already gone from the world――,

Meili: [Yea~h, yea~h, I know you're talking about something really important, but since Petra-chan's dangerous decision won't work, let's get back to the main topic, o~kay?]

Petra: [Mmm, dangerous…]

Meili: [It's dangero~us. If Petra-chan gets caught up in something like a Witch Factor, I'm definitely against it. You can't rely on that kind of pow~er.]

Petra: [Meili-chan…]

Even though she said it without malice, it was clear that she was genuinely concerned about Petra.

Meili knew about Witch Factors without having attended the Witch Tea Party. From what she said, she may have encountered a being with a Witch Factor―― a Sin Archbishop. However, her advice was unexpected.

"Subaru": [――――]

The imaginary Subaru lowered his brow and gazed at Meili with an expression that was too gentle to be called mixed.

With the events surrounding the Sanctuary and the Roswaal mansion, and having been captured in the midst of it all, Meili was involved in those incidents―― the deaths of herself and Frederica that Petra saw in the Book of the Dead.

It was thanks to Subaru's Return by Death that Petra and Meili's relationship did not end as mere victim and perpetrator of death.

Because of that, Petra cannot help but think that power is about how it should be used――,

Petra: […Yeah, I understand.]

Meili: [That's ri~ght. You're a good gi~rl.]

Meili was visibly relieved by Petra's reply. Petra held her hand and nodded.

Either way, if Petra was not compatible with the Witch Factor of Tristitia, the strategy of becoming the factor holder instead of Clind and ignoring the compensation would not work.

If Subaru is a Warlock, and if Petra became a Witch, it was a simple and charming scenario, but without any real advantage, it should be abandoned.

Clind: [As Meili said, we should return to the main topic. Restatement. Regardless, as I explained, compensation will be required. And that compensation is the impact something has on the world. Possibility.]

Petra: [――. Could you please explain it in more detail?]

Clind: [For example, let us say there is a spell that can start a fire with a single word. Its usefulness is obvious, and this spell could open countless future possibilities. Promising. Cooking, medicine, metalworking, blacksmithing, warfare… the list is endless. Expansive. This is influence and possibility. Then――,]

Petra: […If that magic is offered in exchange, everything that could have happened due to that magic would disappear?]

Clind: [As a result, there remains room for the possibility that was originally intended to be used in the world. That allowance, that empty space, allows for the exercise of the incompatible Authority of Tristitia. Conclusion.]

With that conclusion, Petra understood that Clind had finished the necessary explanation.

She understood what he was saying. ――In short, it was a matter of resources. There was a limit to the resources that Od Lagna could manage for the operation of the world.

Essentially, the condition for using Clind's Authority was to sacrifice something of equal value in exchange for resources that were already being used to their fullest extent, and then surreptitiously use the surplus.

Having come to that realization, the clever and lovely Petra noticed something else.

Petra: […Clind-niisama, We used your Authority a lot to get to the Empire. What is the compensation for that?]

Clind: [――. Something from the Master. Confidential.]

Petra: […Seriously, no way.]

Petra's stomach churned with frustration and resentment.

During that situation, everyone in the camp gave their all to rescue Subaru and the others. Beatrice remained asleep, believing that she would be reunited with Subaru, and Otto even compromised his principles to seek help from his hometown. Emilia desperately conveyed her decision, and Petra also did everything she could.

And yet, the one who paid the highest cost was Roswaal, who refused to even mention that fact. For Petra, this was an unbearable humiliation.

"Subaru": [What could it be? A desire for atonement? Like, an apology for the Sanctuary or the mansion?]

Petra: [I don't think it's that easy to understand. That's why I hate the Master…!]

"Subaru": [Yeah, you're right to be angry, Petra…]

The imaginary Subaru still had not read Petra's memories of the Empire, so he was unable to empathize with her emotions, which was frustrating. However, Petra did not want him to understand her ugly, muddy, envious heart, so she cast that mud into the well of her heart, closed the lid, and nailed it shut so that no one could ever peek inside.

The dissatisfaction with Roswaal was not something that was new. Furthermore, it made sense that Roswaal was the most suitable person to fulfill the conditions for using Clind's Authority.

Petra: [The Master has many things that could be used as compensation, such as magic and Magicreation Tools.]

Of course, it is not like if you have a lot, you can spend as much as you want.

It remained unclear whether Od Lagna would consider sentimental value in its evaluation, but sentimental value is a form of possibility that could have influenced the world if it were not discarded. Whatever it may be, Petra did not believe that something without sentimental value could move the world.

――Possibility required passion and commitment.

To offer something that is not genuine to obtain an easy salvation is a cowardly idea, and there is no way that such shameful reasoning can be justified.

That was why Petra――,

Petra: [――I will offer something.]

“Subaru": [Oi, oi.]

Meili thought the same thing as Petra and murmured quietly. While the imaginary Subaru blinked in shock, Meili continued, “Bu~t”,

Meili: [The fact that I'm alive is all thanks to Onii-san and the others letting me off the h~ook. I'm not trying to repay them or anything, but it seems like the right thing to do, ri~ght?]

“Subaru": [Petra, stop this girl… Stop Meili! I don't know what went on between me and her, but that sure wasn't the intention!]

Petra: [Yeah, you're right.]

Despite the change in his expression, the imaginary Subaru's argument was readily accepted.

Subaru helped Meili not because he wanted her to do something in return or because of some other ulterior motive, but simply because he wanted to help her.

Subaru would never let Meili close the door on her possibilities.

Petra: [You can't do that, Meili-chan. The most valuable thing you can offer is your Divine Protection that controls Witchbeasts, and without that, you're worthless.]

Meili: [Hey! Petra-chan, you're being so mean!]

Petra: [Sorry. Worthless is a bit harsh. Meili-chan would still be cute.]

The truth be told, Subaru, Emilia, and the others would probably say that would be fine. However, Meili, of all people, could not accept becoming just a cute girl.

Petra was painfully aware of this. ――Cute girls could not just be cute girls, even if everyone around them thought that would be fine.

???: [――Petra-sama, Meili-sama.]

Suddenly, a voice startled them, and Petra and the others turned around toward the dragon carriage. There, the girl―― Flam had jumped down from the carriage and was running toward them.

While they were traveling through the Augria Sand Dunes, she suddenly lost consciousness, but then later woke up. The reason Flam lost consciousness had something to do with her Divine Protection――,

Petra: [Flam-chan, thank goodness you're awake――]

Flam: [The conditions for using the Divine Protection of Mindspeak have been met. I can contact my sister… Grassis. Hopefully, they will be able to communicate with Felt-sama and Rachins-sama as well.]

Petra: [――――]

Rather than checking on everybody's safety, Flam quickly relayed her own situation.

She must have wanted to contact her fellow camp members immediately after waking up to tell them about the clash between Reinhard and the Witch of Envy, yet she held back and Petra was extremely grateful for that.

Without a doubt, the Felt camp, having received the information from Flam, was also aware of Al's misdeeds and was taking steps to resolve the situation.

“Subaru“: [With Reinhard unable to go anywhere, there’s no telling how much we could rely on Felt and Rom-jii…]

Petra: [――. No. We shouldn't be so stubborn about doing this on our own.]

“Subaru“: [Petra…]

Petra: [This is no longer just our problem, it's a problem for the whole kingdom.]

Al had run amok, and Natsuki Subaru and Beatrice had been captured. ――The situation was no longer a small problem but rather a national or even global crisis involving the Sword Saint, the Divine Dragon, and the Witch of Envy.

That was why it was important for Petra and the others, who knew the situation best, not to withhold any information.

Petra: [Flam-chan, please find out where Felt-sama and the others are right away. If we know where they are, we can join them with Clind-niisama here.]

Flam: [――Hk, Yes, understood.]

After Petra gave her instructions, Flam glanced at Clind for a moment, but resisted the urge to ask for more details and immediately agreed.

In her place, Meili tugged at Petra's sleeves and asked, “Petra-chan?”

Meili: [We still haven't finished discussing the compensation to give to Butler-sa~n.]

Petra: [――No, I've already made up my mind.]

Meili: [Huh?]

Meili's eyes widened at Petra's answer. Petra gently loosened Meili's grip on her sleeve and quickly approached Clind, then glanced out of the corner of her eye at the imaginary Subaru.

Seeing Petra's actions, he stared intently at her, even though she knew that what she was seeing was just a convenient illusion,

Petra: [Cover your ears for a moment.]

In response to Petra's request, the imaginary Subaru paused momentarily and obediently obeyed. When the imaginary Subaru covered his ears, Petra stood on her tiptoes and whispered into "Clind-niisama's" ear.

Then――,

Clind: [――――]

Petra: [――Would that work as compensation?]

Petra lowered her heels and asked the question in a hushed voice. Clind stared at her intently. Petra tilted her head slightly, making an extremely cute gesture, and Clind exhaled.

With a long, deep sigh, he removed his monocle and looked at Petra again with his uncovered eyes.

Clind: [This seems to be possibility. Rough estimation. However, Petra, this is――]

Petra: [I'm glad.]

Clind: [――――]

Petra: [I always knew. ――I always had the possibility to change the world.]

Petra puffed out her chest proudly and did not let Clind say any more.

She received the answer to the question she had only asked Clind. Petra was proud of that answer ――Clind was Clind. Clind's assessment may not necessarily coincide with Od Lagna's, but at least Clind recognized the value of that possibility.

Petra: [I will pay the price, Clind-niisama. We can save the world. …No, I don't really care about the world. I just want to save the people who are precious to me.]

Clind: [――Understood, Petra. You are the bravest girl I know. Admiration.]

Clind bowed deeply and spoke as if he were addressing Annerose, Roswaal, or anyone he truly admired.

In response, Petra returned a smile and noticed Meili staring at her. Seeing the uneasiness in her round eyes, Petra gently embraced her.

Meili: [I can't be su~re, but I'm pretty sure Petra-chan is a huge idi~ot.]

Petra: [Hehe, that's so mean. I'm smart, cute, and cool.]

Petra retorted to Meili's rude remark and hugged her. Then she looked over her shoulder at the imaginary Subaru standing there, looking dazed.

Finally, lowering his hands from his ears, the imaginary Subaru, whose face is so endlessly dear to her, no matter how long she looked at it, Petra updated her personal record for maximum cuteness and declared.

Petra: [Subaru, I love you.]
