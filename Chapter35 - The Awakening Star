*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――When Rem returned to the Roswaal Manor, she was unable to regain any sensation of “coming back home” whatsoever.

???: [Rem, do you see it? That is the mansion belonging to Roswaal-sama, the place where Ram and the others are employed.]

Rem: [Our… workplace…]

As Ram indicated the picturesque scenery endued by rays of the sun falling bright, a sight visible from the window of the dragon carriage, Rem's pale-blue pupils blinked and her eyelids quivered at Ram's words.

They had shared a dragon carriage and headed towards the Industrial City of Costuul, and it had been a while since they boarded the dragon carriage prepared there for their return journey to drop them off―― what entered her sight was her Home, absent in recollection.

A towering gate, and beyond it, a splendid mansion. The Roswaal Mansion, with greater extravagance than even the Berstetz residence she had sojourned in with Katya in the Vollachian Imperial Capital, was a building with elegance incapable of being forgotten after a single glimpse.

Yet――,

Ram: [Well?]

Rem: […I apologize, Nee-sama.]

Rem, spiritless, shook her head and apologized for failing to respond to her elder sister's hopes.

Rem had made the journey thus far apart from Subaru or Emilia and the others who had to move separately towards separate goals, and had made her way back to the mansion with Ram. Having anticipated witnessing many things that would stimulate her memories, yet none so far had managed to bestow truth to that anticipation.

And it seemed that the mansion was no exception, the same mansion so valuable to Rem and Ram.

Ram: [I see. But, it can't be helped. After all, it was quite a while ago that Ram and Rem worked in this mansion, and the mansion deeply memorable to Rem is not in this place.]

Rem: [Huh!?]

Ram: [Incidentally, the previous mansion was lit aflame by a vexed Otto and therefore is no longer extant. Would've thought of taking a detour to visit it had it remained not ashen to the ground.]

Rem: [Otto-san did… yet he didn't seem to be a person of such kind.]

Rem’s eyes gyrated at the appended report, with further bewilderment at the information about Otto that Ram had recited.

The Internal Affairs Minister of the camp, Otto was a mild-mannered person, an inseparable friend and ally to Subaru, and a completely sleepless individual according to Petra and Frederica. The information of him furthermore setting the mansion ablaze in vexation, detracted from his character.

It might have been, as they say, that people do not match their appearances, and it might have been a good thing to accept that now.

Rem: [Including that person, are Emilia-san's allies all a gathering of such people? Like Garfiel, and Roswaal-san too…]

Ram: [It's, Roswaal-sama.]

Rem: […Roswaal-sama too.]

Ram: [Good girl. But, to group Roswaal-sama together with those three, bad girl, Rem. Roswaal-sama is wise and proficient, the person said to be the most excelling magician in this world. Compared to him, those three, they're the worth of one person when you put all three of them together… no, about the worth of half a person.]

Rem: [Half a person as three people together…]

Imagining Otto, Garfiel, and finally Subaru riding atop each other's shoulders, Rem then arranged Roswaal, capable of flying via magic, beside the three in her mind. And upon lining them up, albeit Rem was ignorant of what difference would lie between them, it seemed Ram's say was not mistaken.

Even now with null prospects of her memories returning, for Rem, the faith and endearment she felt coming from the familiarity she could feel from Ram, her twin elder sister, that alone was indubitably genuine.

――For that was the definitive nexus, which connected the Rem of the past with the present.

Rem: […That manner of thinking, will purchase a scolding from Priscilla-san.]

Bitter sentiments surfacing in her mind, Rem recollected the gaze of a woman, fiery scarlet in hue.

She, who had engraved a marked impact onto Rem's way of thinking and progressing, would never bless a bearing of fixating and clinging onto the past. In the same way, she would never favor a Rem flattered by Ram, entrusting herself to the nectar of faith.

Rem did not wish to be disliked by Priscilla, nor did she wish to walk an ashamed path of life. 
Hence, she reprimanded her heart verging on pessimism, slapped her cheeks, and lifted her visage.

Rem: [But Nee-sama, going by this, then wouldn't that mean there won't be many paths to my memories’ return, even upon returning to that mansion?]

Ram: [Huhu, swift grasp. An astute little sister makes Ram proud as well.]

Rem: [No, not at all… I do not think that is anything deserving of such praise from you, Nee-sama…]

Ram: [However, just whose elder sister do you think the Ram standing here is? Do you think Ram, Rem's Nee-sama, would make such an oversight?]

With her hand on her chest, Ram declared so with a visage brimming in confidence. 

Rem earnestly shamed her own misapproximated worries at Ram's bold utterance. Ram had foreseen it without needing to be told by Rem.

What roused curiosity, then, were Ram's ideas――,

Rem: [If we are returning to the mansion, yet that itself is not the goal, then… is the goal, a person?]

Ram: [Who knows. Whether your answer is correct… you will be able to ascertain soon.]

Ram smiled at Rem's estimation, as the dragon carriage stopped at roughly the same time.

Feeling the jolting long kept at bay by the Divine Protection of Wind Evasion, Rem was shaken as Ram stood up and gallantly proffered her hand to her.

Ram: [Well then, we've arrived. Let's go.]

Rem: [――Yes, Nee-sama.]

Taking Ram's hand, Rem restrained her chest, faintly jouncing in anxiety, and dismounted from the dragon carriage.

As Ram spoke to the driver who had carried them thus far, Rem took a step forward from the dragon carriage and captured in her view the mansion and the serene front garden beyond the bars of the iron gate.

Rem: [This place is…]

As Rem narrowed her pale-blue eyes, the mansion reflected within her pupils, indeed, she possessed no recollection of.

Nevertheless, apprehending the attentive management that reached the building and flower beds, the hedges, and every nook and cranny that shaped the mansion, she inadvertently straightened her posture.

Regardless of the presence or absence of her memories, if Rem were to abide in this mansion hereon, then her position would surely be that of a servant like Ram and Frederica.

???: [Rem, you should just live a healthy and carefree life every day.]

For a moment, the impression of Subaru vocalizing this came to mind, but Rem forcibly repelled this over-indulging phantom.

Subaru, for certain, would likely say something along those lines, but he was toiling at something else at this moment.

Incomparable to Rem, right now, in order to console the one who sustained lacerations on his heart from losing Priscilla, he was――,

???: [――Oh? Oh, oooh, ooooh!]

Hearing a sudden bellow, Rem drew back with an "Eek!".

She could tell the voice came from beyond the bars, that was to say, from the grounds of the mansion. ――Present there was the form of a young girl, her miniature hands gripping the bars, eyes wide and frozen steady.

Adorable features, adorned with long, pink hair. Height seeming to indicate about eleven or twelve years of age and a black garb enveloping her entire body save for her head, the young girl widened her spherical eyes and fixed her gaze upon Rem.

Rem had recollections, of this girl. ――From the vortex of the cataclysm within the Empire.

Rem: [Y-You are… the Witch who brought on the Great Disaster!]

Ram: [Ah, Ryuzu-sama, thank you for the welcoming.]

She shuddered in fear, as the bearer of the Great Disaster extended a finger towards her.

Beside Rem's horror at the sudden, implausible reunion with the disaster, Ram swiftly stepped forward and spoke to the girl. Rem turned towards Ram with a “Huh?” at her prosaic behaviour, and the Witch also scowled at her in a snap,

Ryuzu: [Ram! You're home. You're home but… you're a quick one!]

Ram: […Are you asking Ram to pick you up the way Garf and Frederica do, Ryuzu-sama?]

Ryuzu: [That ain't what I'm sayin’! Puttin’ that 'side, that girl…]

Rem: [Nee-sama, who is this person…]

The Witch who had plotted the ruin of the Empire, her name being Sphinx.

However, Ram referred to the girl before her eyes with a disparate name―― Ryuzu. Ryuzu's line of sight once again on her, Rem perplexedly glanced at Ram.

At the reaction of the two, Ram gently placed her hand atop Rem's shoulder,

Ram: [Kindly give your name to her.]

Rem: [――――]

Despite the absence of even a minimal explanation, Ram's calm timbre marvelously soothed Rem's roiled heart. Her disarray naturally coming undone, Rem turned towards Ryuzu.

Stabilising her breath, and steadily gazing into her opponent's eyes,

Rem: [――I'm Rem. Am I right to assume that you are… Ryuzu-san?]

Ryuzu: […I, see. Yeah. Hm, yeah. I'm Ryuzu, Rem.]

Rem gave her name and enquired hers, to which Ryuzu momentarily had a distant glint in her eye, then softly nodded.
。
From her response, Ram's attitude, and the fact that she was on the premises of Roswaal's mansion, Rem was at last able to harbor conviction that the girl before her and the Witch of the Empire were separate persons.

Rem: [Even so, the resemblance is exceeding…]

Ram: [Yes. There's a saying that there's at least three people in the world with a face that resembles yours, but in Ryuzu-sama's case, there are about ten times that. Hence, also ten times her crudity.] [1]

Ryuzu: [What a detestable thin’ ta say at a moment the elderly’d be gettin’ all emotional.]

Rem alluded to the misleading nature of her appearance, as Ryuzu scolded Ram for her reply.

It was tellable from their exchanges as well, but the two had a fairly relaxed relationship. Judging from Ryuzu’s attitude, she must have also been someone who had a deep relationship with the Rem of the past.

Rem: [Forgive me. But, I don't remember anything.]

Ryuzu: [No matter no matter, ain't nothin’ ta be apologisin’ fer. I am――]

Ram: [――Ram's little sister. She has the same hair color as Ram, after all.]

Rem: [Th-that's true…! Huh, but if she is Nee-sama's little sister, then that means…]

Ram interrupted Ryuzu and divulged a shocking truth. Her breath taken away by stupefaction, Rem compared Ram and Ryuzu, deeming a convincibility in their hair colors.

However, Ram and Rem were supposed to be twins, so inevitably, Rem and Ryuzu's relation would come down to being――,

Rem: [Also my… little sister…?]

Ryuzu: [Cut th’ cackle, Ram! This's what 'm sayin’! ‘S the bad influence of Lil’ Ros 'n Lil’ Su!]

Ram: [To enumerate them as equals? Even you, Ryuzu-sama, have things you are and aren't allowed to do.]

Ryuzu: [Ain't somethin’ ya should be sayin’ with that tone!]

The brows of her cute face upraised, Ryuzu yelled aloud, to which Ram furrowed her eyebrows. Watching the quarrel between the two, Rem finally gauged that Ram had spoken in jest.

Rem: [Now that I think of it, it would certainly be strange for Nee-sama to address Ryuzu-san with '-sama’ if she were mine or Nee-sama's little sister.]

Ryuzu: [In that case, ya could mistake 'em fer a father or mother, dependin’ on the situation, leavin’ the possibility of them bein’ a blood sister ta an important someone. Can't say that's some kinda perfect rebuttal.]

Rem: [That is also true… Then, you really are mine and Nee-sama's…?]

Ryuzu: [Nah. Don't'cha mistake it fer anythin’ but a bad joke of Ram's. Seriously, what a headache.]

Ryuzu heaved a heavy sigh, to which Ram had her tongue slightly peeking out. 

She had been played like a fiddle it seemed, but thinking back to it even along their journey to this place, Ram had quite often stumped Rem in her playfulness, and in doing so granted her salvation.

For Rem, quick to drown for the slightest of reasons, Ram's way, abounding in conviction and humor, was truly akin to the warmth of the sun.

Rem: [I believe Nee-sama is a wonderful person. Including this playfulness.]

Ryuzu: [From what was informed in the birdmail, ain't been too many days since ya reunited, yet ta ‘ve tamed her this much…]

Rem: ["Tame her" is a boorish way to put it. I simply devoted sincerity and love.]

Ryuzu: [Fer that, you're frolicin’ too much ta an uncharacteristic level, Ram. Though I do understand yer happiness for bein’ able ta live with yer lil’ sis’ after her finally wakin’ up from her neverendin’ sleep.]

Ram: [――. How cheeky for a mere Ryuzu-sama.]

Ryuzu: [Ya get in attack mode when you're hidin’ yer embarrassment, so nevermind me, but I wish ya'd have some consideration with Lil’ Gar. Now then…]

Ram faintly frowned. Rem was struck with admiration at the rare state of her elder sister being cornered, when Ryuzu stepped away from the bars after having been leaning upon the iron gate,

Ryuzu: ['S weird ta keep talkin’ at the gate. I also wanna give a big hug to my granddaughters fer comin’ back safe ‘n sound.]

Rem: [Granddaughters…?]

Ram: [That's the best joke she could come up with. Kindly laugh for her.]

Ryuzu: [It means that's how much I think of ya!]

As Ryuzu tapered her lips, Rem's own lips loosened even through her perplexment. Not because Ram had told her to, it just spontaneously happened in response to Ryuzu's thoughtfulness.

Above all, for Ryuzu to treat Rem and Ram as granddaughters despite looking younger than them was a truly apocryphal element, even taking her thoughtfulness into account.

Rem: [Beatrice-chan was the same way, but is it the tendency of young children to act older than they are…?]

Ram: [It would seem so. Beatrice-sama’s true self appears when she is atop Barusu's lap.]

Rem: [Considering her cuteness, I would have to agree.]

Spica was the same way, but it befitted children best to be like children, laughing to their fullest. Not just Beatrice, but if Ryuzu also stopped trying to act older and smiled suitably for her age, just how adorable she would be.

Immersed in these introspections, Rem's cognizance momentarily paused at what immediately followed.

Ryuzu: [Now then everybody, let's open the gates.]

Upon apprehending what Ryuzu had vocalized, the iron gate to the mansion slowly began to open.

That, by itself, was good. Without issue. The issue lay beyond the gate's opening.

???: [――――]
???: [――――]

The gate's latches unfastened, the gateway opening to the inside―― moving it were several persons abiding by Ryuzu's calling, each with hair and ornaments that adorned them differing per the respective liking of each, yet all of them wore the same face as Ryuzu.

Namely, those girls possessed an identical visage as the Witch Sphinx――,

Rem: [――eek!!]

Expectably overwhelmed, without curtail, Rem screeched to her limit.

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [That scream baffled me, but I understand. Most certainly anyone would be astonished after seeing Ryuzu-sama and her sisters, Pico-sama and the rest.]

Rem: [For you to say that, gives me some relief…]

Rem hung her head in shame before the blonde-haired maid who indicated her sympathy.

The greeting with Ryuzu at the gate, and the frightening affairs that followed―― the entrance of more than ten girls bearing the same face as Ryuzu's, made her feel incredibly embarrassed for her delirious response to it.

Rem: [Even though Nee-sama had apprised me there were an amount of people about three times ten who had a face identical to Ryuzu-san, yet I reckoned she was only joking…]

Ryuzu: [‘S the way Ram spoke, but ya also can't fault yerself fer thinkin’ that way, Rem. Fer ya ta not think of it as a joke'd be blind belief, 'n I can't say I approve of that.]

???: [You speak of it quite nonchalantly, but would it not be good for you to take a look in the mirror yourself as well, Ryuzu-sama? If you continue to cause problems so frequently that it will be impossible to discount them despite your adorable appearance, then it will be about time I took matters in my own hands.]

Ryuzu: [Y-You're scarin’ me…]

Glowered by those somewhat tranquil eyes, Ryuzu curled up in reflection. This made Rem loosen her lips at last as she corrected her hunched posture.

She had never predicted such a commotion would be stirred up even before she had entered the mansion's premises, but now that she had been permitted to pass inside, she could not keep moping this way forever.

Although――,

Rem: [I caused you trouble by making a ruckus. Um…]

Sylphy: [――I am Sylphy Elmart. Previously Corneas, but I have since divorced. I have been entrusted to attend to the mansion during everyone's absence.]

Rem: [The mansion. Then, were you also a coworker of mine and Nee-sama's, Sylphy-san?]

Rem inquired so of the maid, who gently lowered her back and bowed―― Sylphy.
Rem inquired so of the maid―― Sylphy, who gently lowered her back and bowed.

Albeit a matter of course, it was likely that all of the women who worked at Roswaal's mansion were acquaintances of Rem. Surely, she must have troubled them owing to her slumber.

However, Sylphy shook her head and denied Rem's concern with a “No”,

Sylphy: [I am still a newcomer, so I have never worked with Rem-sama and the others. In addition, I have been employed not by the Margrave, but by Miload-sama. Furthermore.]

Rem: [Furthermore?]

Sylphy: [My master is myself alone. And my heart's master is none other than Emilia-sama.]

Overawed by Sylphy's gaze, perfused with potent willpower, Rem's head unwittingly inclined backward.

The unordinary allegiance Sylphy had attested for Emilia. It could also be discerned from the flawless maintenance of the entry hall, the passageways, and the parlor she was presently in, all of which she had seen on her tour around the mansion with Sylphy. In accordance with her impression of the mansion from the outside, the professionalism was remarkable.

This work incontrovertibly emanated from the emotions which exalted Emilia as even the master of her heart.

Rem: [Sylphy-san, have you known Emilia-san for a long time?]

Sylphy: [No, it has only been a few months since we met. And that, too, was an exceedingly limited timeframe in which I was able to be in her company personally.]

Rem: [And yet, you devote such emotion to her?]

Sylphy: [It is what that person did for you, rather than the length of time you spent with them, that determines to what extent that person will occupy your heart, is it not?]

Rem: [That's…]

Taken aback by the unexpected reply, Rem cast her gaze downward at Sylphy's continuing words.

That which crossed Rem's mind in this moment were the figures of people she cherished, Spica and Katya. However, taking also into account that they were relationships Rem had fostered anew without her memories, the time Rem had spent with them was not a great number of days by any measure.

Nevertheless, still, Rem resolutely felt them to be irreplaceable.

What Sylphy had said was correct. ――And, as Rem neared this conviction, a clear image of Subaru's visage emerged within her mind, making her purse her lips shut.

Sylphy: [Rem-sama?]

Ryuzu: [She must be befuddled. Sylphy, I'm sure I told ya 'bout Rem's circumstance.]

Sylphy: [You are… correct. My apologies. I lacked consideration.]

Rem: [No, there is no need for you to apologize. ――It's simply… my circumstance.]

Ryuzu and Sylphy exchanged glances upon hearing Rem's reply. Albeit to the heartache of the cordial two, Rem did not wish to speak of her present conflict.

As expressed, it was Rem's own distress, her own anguish to the very end.

Ram: [――You look downhearted, Rem. Did Sylphy tease you or such?]

Rem: [――――]

Upon the voice abruptly calling for her, Rem raised her face and gazed at the parlor's entrance. Standing there was Ram, having momentarily parted from her in the middle of guiding her towards the parlor to see to certain business.

As Ram belatedly enjoined them, Rem gulped an inhale with eyes wide at her appearance. ――For Ram stood there in an unfamiliar maid garb.

Rem: [Nee-sama, that attire…]

Ram: [Were you not told so multiple times? Ram is the mansion's, Roswaal-sama's maid.]

Rem was inadvertently captivated by Ram's response, who combed down her pink hair exuberantly. Looking at Ram all the same as Rem, Ryuzu exhaled a jaunty “Ahh”,

Ryuzu: [Been a minute since we seen Ram in this kinda attire, ain't that so.]

Ram: [Indeed. Ram had been wearing her travel clothing for some time, so it feels refreshing.]

Sylphy: [So refreshing that it would seem some parts of the uniform are disordered in the manner they have been worn. May I fix them?]

Ram: [Is that so? Then your help is requested.]

Beside the mesmerized Rem, Ryuzu was enthralled as Sylphy quietly began assisting with Ram's dressing. Whilst Sylphy's hands adjusted her uniform, Ram met Rem's gaze by closing one eye and winking at her,

Ram: [This is the maid uniform that Ram and Rem wear whilst working in the mansion.]

Rem: […I think it is, wonderful. But…]

Ram: [But?]

Rem: [Doesn't it expose a bit more skin compared to Sylphy-san's uniform? Just what difference… could it be, that person was behind it?]

Comparing the maid outfits of Ram and Sylphy, Rem bore this misgiving whilst hugging her own shoulders.

It was a lovely outfit, to be sure, but the discrepancy was much too clear and its intent, unknown. And when she thought back to it, in the Empire, Subaru would often vest convoluted statements upon her by alluding to Rem's attire, telling her what would be cuter, what would make her more alluring, et cetera. The memories of those times were resurrected by the uniforms before her eyes.

Rem: [I did think he had an abnormal obsession in even the attire of others, but for it to show up even here…]

Sylphy: […It would seem a misunderstanding has occurred, Ram-sama?]

Ram: [Indeed. Ram personally is not concerned whatsoever by how much Barusu's repute falls to the gutter in Rem's mind, but it is unamusing to have credit stolen.]

Rem: [Credit, you say?]

Ram: [Yes. This maid uniform's alteration was something Ram personally proposed and adjusted. All of it was because… Ram wished to wear a uniform with better mobility? Is what… it was supposed to be?]

Ryuzu: [Where'd that confidence of yers go all of a sudden?]

As Ram’s confidence uncharacteristically wilted by the end of her utterance, Ryuzu tilted her head. Upon Ryuzu's delineation, Ram muttered “Quite incomprehensible”,

Ram: [To be skeptical of one's own opinion, how unpleasant. The reason why Ram proposed the uniform's alteration was, probably, not supposed to be something so randomly offhanded like that.]

Sylphy: [Y-You say that for your own opinion!?]

Ram: [It feels to be a scheme of the uniforms' provider… It is irksome for being a thought akin to Barusu's, but if they wanted to make Rem wear a cute uniform, that would be much more convincing.]

Sylphy: [I see, most certainly. I am persuaded.]

One finger on her lips, Sylphy for some reason endorsed Ram's inference. Judging from the flow of this conversation, Sylphy probably had the urge to dress someone in cute clothes as well.

In reality, in a world where the memories of the majority of people surrounding Rem had disappeared, the true nature of Ram's malaise and the correct answer to it would likely never be known.

Ram: [If so, then Ram will believe what she wishes to believe. Unafraid of what anyone else may ever think, you see.]

Rem: […I'm sure Nee-sama would've found Priscilla-sama agreeable as well.]

Albeit Rem's companionships were few and confined, as both noble and powerful women, Priscilla and Ram possessed radiant and admirable commonalities. Had Priscilla been alive and well, there would have been a future in which the two would have come to good terms with one another through Rem. Or, they would have collided against one another as natural enemies.

Anyhow, her suspicions towards Subaru concerning the maid uniforms seemed misplaced.

Rem: [But, it's all because that person is constantly doing such misleading things.]

Ryuzu: [If you're talkin’ ‘bout Lil’ Su, it's a pity ya give flak to him.]

Rem: [Ryuzu-san, you're able to say this because you haven't witnessed that person say all sorts of nonsense and crossdress as a woman.]

Ryuzu: [To think! Lil’ Su was crossdressin’ even in the Empire! He's oughta be learnin' some manners.]

Sylphy: [Crossdress as a woman? Despite the presence of Emilia-sama's person? With what purpose? Depending on that answer…]

Ryuzu's reaction evinced that Subaru truly was a repeat offender. Sylphy expressed a stern displeasure upon hearing this, and Rem was determined to grill him about this once again in her mind.

During this exchange, Sylphy completed her dressing of Ram. Ram swiftly twirled, flipping the hem of her skirt, as she exuberantly stroked her hair upward,

Ram: [Nothing uncomfortable. Good work, Sylphy.]

Sylphy: […Your compliment is an honor, is what I will state for the record.]

Ram: [It's Ram's commendation, so kindly accept it in stride. That's not all. From a cursory glance, you've attended to the mansion quite meticulously as well.]

Sylphy: [I did live days of subservience beneath an unsalvageable Husband-sama. Should even a speck of dirt be fallen onto the floor, each wife would bear the corollary of worthlessness. It is infuriating to even remember. Although recently, he reaped what he had sown.]

Having corrected Ram's uniform in an instant, Sylphy spoke of her previous place of employment―― no, her environment, perhaps. It could be glimpsed through her words and conduct how debilitating that place was, to which Rem also felt a great sympathy.

And, before this Rem, upon shifting into a flawless maid, Ram gently set a cup of tea.

Ram: [Here, you must be parched after all of Ryuzu-sama and Sylphy's enquiries.]

Ryuzu: [Paintin’ us as villains even when you're just handin’ a cup of tea, eh.]

Ram: [Hah.]

Scoffing an exhale at the sour-lipped Ryuzu, Ram laid out tea for her and Sylphy as well.

Seemingly having brought the serving stand to the corridor, Ram adeptly poured the two's tea and, with her gaze, urged Rem to take a sip. Heeding her direction, Rem delayed not in enjoying the tea's aroma any further and placed the cup to her mouth―― her eyes reflexively dilated.

Rem: [Delicious…]

Ram: [Isn't it. Brewing tea is Ram's sole specialty as a maid, after all.]

Sylphy: [You carry yourself with contrasting seriousness to a nearly enchanting degree… Not that I can say much, since truthfully, I have never had the opportunity to enjoy tea of such quality.]

Ryuzu: [Even Frederica's always happy ta say this one's peerless.]

Sylphy and Ryuzu also yielded in defeat to the triumphant Ram and sipped their tea.

Savoring the aroma entering her nostrils and the flavor atop her tongue, whilst nodding to the two's voicing, Rem took a sudden notice to Ram’s gentle gaze, affection and somber hope dwelling within.

Rem: [――Ah.]

Ram would never verify. But, surely, she must have conferred her hopes onto even the flavor of this tea.

It was not arduous to imagine that before losing her memories, Rem also overindulged in the flavor of this esteem, of this tea which only Ram could make. In reality, her serving of the tea, artful enough to bedew one's tear ducts in captivation, seemed to imbue every fragment of Rem's body with affection.

It did not, however, stimulate Rem's memories, and forge the outcome desired for.

Rem: [It is very, truly very delicious. But――.]

Placing the cup she had finished sipping from upon the table, and with eyes closed, Rem spoke so evasively. However, to Rem's conduct, Ram smiled with a “Fool”,

Ram: [This was simply brewing some tea. Nowhere near any necessity for this cute Rem to apologize.]

Sylphy: [Ram-sama, you may have made her apologize due to your stabbing gaze. My former Husband-sama was an inordinately temperamental person, but he kept in good spirits if he were to just receive apologies in the meanwhile.]

Ryuzu: […Oh dear Ram, would ya pour 'nother cuppa tea for Sylphy? I feel so awful, so awful fer this girl.]

Sylphy: [Why would you feel so? Contrary to feeling pity, I am rejoicing in the freedom which I never had before.]

Slightly furrowing her eyebrows, Sylphy informed Ryuzu, eyes sorrowful, of her incredulity. Complying with Ryuzu's entreaty, Ram began preparing a second cup for Sylphy.

Whilst glimpsing Ram's back, once again did Rem ardently, fervently resolve.

…I want to repay, the people who are so good to me.

△▼△▼△▼△

After she left the reception area, Rem wandered around the mansion at her leisure.

Every time she stopped, Ram followed her and spoke of memories associated with the places they passed, such as, “That's the flower bed where Barusu covered himself with fertilizer,” or “Here is the pillar where Garf left gnaw marks. He will be scolded later“, and “Look, the portrait of the Great Spirit-sama that Emilia-sama and Beatrice-sama drew on the ground is still there.” There was no time for her to feel lonely.

However, despite Ram's companionship and thoughtfulness, Rem could not find something that would give her the impetus she felt she needed."

Rem: [Oh, there are more children who look like Ryuzu-sama…]

Ram: [Those are Picos. They were taken out of the Sanctuary and are currently undergoing training from square one.]

Rem: […My situation is similar to that of Sylphy-san and those children.]

Unlike Ryuzu, who seemed unusually mature for her age, these girls looked as innocent as their appearance suggested. ――With Pico at the forefront, they could be seen all over the spacious Roswaal mansion, helping out as maids dressed in the same uniform as Sylphy.

Those girls, who looked so earnest, seemed to have been born with a destiny different from most people, but now they had been freed from their fate and were in the midst of living a different life.

On the other hand, most of the maids drew attention for their beauty and elegance, but apparently, many of them had been in equally poor circumstances as Sylphy and were rescued by Emilia.

Ryuzu's sisters and the maids were also in the same position as Rem in that their lives were toyed with and tossed about by fate.

However, Ram responded to Rem's thoughts with “Well,” and then,

Ram: [Regardless of whether you have memories or not, once you decide to start walking down a new path, there is usually no choice but to start over from square one. Rem is no different.]

Rem: [Nee-sama…]

Ram: [No, that is a mistake. Rem is special. She is far too precious to Ram.]

Rem blushed and turned away, embarrassed by the amount of love she was being shown.

Of course, Rem also felt a strong affinity for Ram and overflowing love for her, but while Rem could only give one thing, she felt like she was receiving many times that from Ram, which made her feel uneasy.

With that feeling of unease still lingering, Rem and Ram continued their tour of Roswaal's mansion for a while.

And then eventually――,

Ram: [――Rem, this is your room.]

The guest rooms were not particularly noteworthy about the guest rooms compared to the other rooms in the mansion they saw, such as the reception area, dining room, large bath, secret training area, lounge, gardens, and balcony.

Given the size of the mansion, the room given to Rem, who was just a servant, was quite spacious, but that was about it.

Rem: [――――]

There was a large bed and a bookshelf filled with collections of poetry and picture storybooks. The writing desk was neatly tidied up, and a vase decorated with fresh flowers was placed on it.

Ram: [Once before, without realizing it, all of your personal belongings were tidied up, but Barusu pulled everything back out and put it all back where it was, saying that this was how Rem had it.]

Rem: [He…]

Rem stood in front of the bookshelf, with Ram telling her about Subaru's efforts.

Ram was generally known for her sharp rhetoric toward Subaru, and Rem often found herself nodding in agreement. However, the words she added just now were filled with nothing but sincerity, striking Rem to her core.

Rem removed a collection of poems and turned the pages. None of the poems were familiar, but they were probably poems that the former Rem cherished and enjoyed. Many of them dealt with love and romance, and it made her feel both amused and embarrassed about her past self's tastes.

Rem: [I was asleep for over a year.]

After putting the collection of poems back on the bookshelf, Rem sat down on the bed and gently stroked it, narrowing her eyes.

Unable to wake from her slumber and perform her duties as a maid, Rem's duties were taken over by Ram, Frederica, Petra, and others, who took care of the mansion and looked after the bedridden Rem every day. Even now, the pillows and sheets on her bed were kept clean, showing the care that went into their work.

Next to the bed, faint traces of discoloration on the floor indicated that a chair had been placed there for a long time. Rem imagined the scene of someone visiting her while she was asleep and talking to her.

It must have been Ram, Emilia, and――,

Rem: [――――]

Ram quietly sat down next to Rem on the bed. Rem closed her eyes and shook her head as Ram's gentle, light pink gaze looked at her profiled face.

It had not been asked, but she likely wanted to know.

There was nothing in this entire mansion, nothing in this entire room, that stirred Rem's memories. All that was here was a wealth of affection, things that made her feel loved, constantly serving as reminders to the amnesiac Rem that she had once been a truly fortunate person.

It was so deep and powerful that it brought tears to her eyes.

That was why――,

Rem: […Nee-sama, I'm really curious about something. What is that?]

Sunlight filtered through the trees, filling the room with soft warmth and a sense of kindness. In one corner of the room rested a mysterious object―― a spiked iron ball attached to a chain whose unusual appearance caught her eye.

In response to Rem's question, Ram released a soft “ah” as if she had realized something,

Ram: [That's a morning star.]

Rem: […Morning, star?]

Ram: [Yes. Barusu was the one who first started calling it that, and before long, it stuck… But apparently, it was something you treasured, Rem.]

Rem: [Me, that thing!?]

What was said was so different from her memories that had been recounted up until then, which made Rem and Ram exchange glances repeatedly, between Ram and the spiked iron ball―― the morning star.

After hearing that, Rem was almost convinced that it was just another one of Ram's playful jokes.

Ram: “Ram understands your doubts. But seeing Barusu preparing a special cloth and oil and polishing it every day, Ram thinks that it's too much effort for a trivial joke.]

Rem: [B-but, but, that person seems like the type who would do something so boring, right?]

Ram: [Yes, that is something that can't be denied.]

Perhaps because the discussion was already exhausted, Ram's response to Rem's rebuttal was tinged with resignation. Rem noticed Ram's demeanor, rose from the bed, and approached the morning star.

Rem: [I don't understand…]

Upon closer inspection, she noticed there was a handmade iron ball holder to prevent the spikes from scratching the floor, which showed great attention to detail. The cloth and oil container placed in the same spot confirmed Ram's words that Subaru polished it every day.

However, if one asked what does that mean, she could not say.

Rem: [This is probably just another one of that man's practical jokes――]

Like with the cross-dressing, it must have been just a malicious thing that sounded authentic, but was just a reflection of Subaru's tastes.

Having thought so, Rem bent down and touched the iron ball with her finger. ――In that instant.

Rem: [――Huh.]

Suddenly, Rem's vision distorted, and she involuntarily dropped to the floor. It was an undignified position, but she had no time to feel embarrassed.

Rem: [Uh…]

Even after falling on her rear, her vision spun around and around as the dizziness continued.

Even though she was there, she could no longer distinguish between the floor and the ceiling, and the world turned upside down. Her sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, blended in confusion, causing her to see the air, smell the sounds, touch the smells, taste the colors, and hear the smells.

Rem: [――Ah, ug.]

Everything she felt blended together, stirred up, intermingling Rem's past, present, and future.

A mountain village, a flag emblazoned with a wolf pierced by a sword, the creaking sound of wheelchair wheels, a horde of flying dragons that darkend the sky, a hideous white whale flew through the night sky, and a broken horn danced through the twilight illuminated by flames, along with a boy pleading in despair, enraged, in tears, and smiling――.

Rem: [――――]

And then, the sensation of the world being completely remade suddenly burst like a bubble.

Rem: [――――]

Sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, each one is seen, heard, smelled, tasted, and touched, informing one of the true nature of life.

Rem blinked once, twice, three times, as she felt the intense, burning sensation and the resulting palpitations sent blood rushing through every inch of her body.

She had no understanding of what had happened.

However――,

Rem: [I…Rem, am.]

Still seated on the floor, she touched her cheek with a trembling hand to confirm its presence.

The sensation of her fingertips lingering on her skin refused to fade. Fearful that she might crumble away like a delicate, fragile sandcastle, Rem could not bring herself to apply any more pressure to her fingers.

It felt as if she sought anything more, everything would disappear.

Rem: [――――]

Overcame by an unavoidable sense of anxiety and fear, Rem was enveloped by a warm sensation from behind.

Her breath caught in her throat, and she froze, unable to turn around. Rem was embraced by arms that wrapped around her from behind, and she found the opportunity to shift her thoughts and feelings away from herself.

And first to face her was the presence that embraced her from behind――,

Rem: [Nee-Sa――]

Ram: [――Wait.]

Rem: [――――]

Ram: [Don't turn around just yet. Right now, Ram is feeling disappointed in herself for the first time in her life.]

Rem was about to speak and turn around, but the other person stopped her, and she froze.

Ram, who was unable to look face-to-face with Rem, the arms she had wrapped around her, and the voice she had raised, were all quivering. This was too far removed from the Ram that Rem knew.

Rem had always seen Ram as a dignified, courageous, and imposing figure.

It was the same when they reunited in the Empire, on their journey together back to Roswaal's mansion, when she first started working at the mansion and was struggling with her newly broken horn, and when she fought fiercely against the Witch Cult in the burning village to protect the foolish Rem.

To Rem, Ram had always been perfect――.

Ram: [Sorry, Rem. This is so pathetic of me.]

Rem: [Nee-sama… What are…]

Ram: [How could,]

Rem: [――――]

Ram: [How could Ram be such a heartless older sister to go on living and forgetting about her beloved and precious Rem all this time?]

Rem's eyes widened at Ram's voice, filled with regret due to her overwhelming love. Then, ignoring all attempts to stop her, Rem turned around and faced Ram as she hugged her.

Ram: [――Hk.]

Ram stared at Rem with surprise, her pale pink eyes slightly moist. ――It was the face she had spent the most time looking at in her entire life, and her heart raced.

She was left convinced of how happy she was and how surrounded she was by things she loved.

Rem: [Nee-sama isn't heartless. Rem is the one who should be sorry. For so long, Rem has caused her older sister nothing but worry. Rem is a disgraceful sister.]

Ram: [Rem.]

Rem: [Rem remembers everything. How much Nee-sama cared for Rem, how much she sacrificed, and how she stayed with me until now. And…]

Ram: [Rem…]

Rem: [Rem is weak and pathetic, who only knows how to take, must Rem now do what is needed.]

Ram: [――Hk.]

Looking directly at Ram's face, Rem wiped the tears running down her cheeks with her finger and smiled. Then she reached out, pulled her sister's head closer, and hugged her to her chest.

Sitting flat on the floor, the two sisters gently embraced each other, cherishing each other. ――No, Ram had always cherished Rem. It was Rem who had been unable to do the same.

Rem: [Nee-sama, Rem loves you.]

Rem held Ram close, brought her lips close to Ram's ear, and conveyed her overflowing feelings. Feeling the warm tears slowly wet her chest, Rem continued to hold Ram, who was silently crying.

Finally, Rem wholeheartedly accepted their reunion, fulfilled in its fullest sense, and expressed her love with everything she had, both past and present selves.

Rem wanted to spend time with Ram like this until she felt satisfied and content.

If Rem could truly reclaim the time she lost with her sister―― there would be so many people to whom she would have to express her love and gratitude.

In particular, the first person that came to mind was a black-haired boy with mean-looking eyes――,

"--Subaru-kun"
Rem: [――Subaru-kun.]

To convey her love, she had to stand up.
 
What a wonderful reason she had for being alive. ――That was what Rem thought.

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [――――]

The girl in the maid uniform bowed deeply, then looked up, and Petra gasped.

With wide eyes, their bodies frozen in place, Petra, Meili, and Emilia were all speechless at her appearance.

Amidst such involuntary silence, the first to speak was――,

???: [――Rem.]

The intangible imaginary Subaru stood motionless, looking at the same person as Petra.

His voice, filled with shock and disbelief, reached no one but Petra. Sadly, the girl who was the focus of everyone's attention could not see him, as he was translucent. Petra had no time to try to help the unnoticed “Subaru.”

However, “Subaru” was undoubtedly calling out correctly. ――Standing there was undoubtedly Rem, one whom he cherished dearly.

Petra: [――Ah.]

At that moment, sparks ran through Petra's mind, and the hazy field of consciousness gradually cleared.

The source of the attraction lay just before her eyes, and the images of memories that had been unconsciously pushed into the corner of her mind and covered with a veil of forgetfulness began to reappear in the corridor of her consciousness.

And so, she was struck by the sparkling impact of all the colorful images that were shown.

 ――The time Petra spent with her as “Petra” was not very long.

Frequently, a young maid would visit her village from Roswaal's mansion to run errands. Though they hardly interacted and had never exchanged a word, she became more expressive once Subaru started visiting the village. More importantly, she was the one who saved Petra's life. ――Ironically, it was Meili, who was controlling the Witchbeasts, who had endangered her life. In fact, Meili and her older sister seem to be overly fixated on targeting the lives of those connected to her.

That said, Petra did not have much contact with her.

Later, shortly after the start of the Royal Selection, she fell victim to the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, and Petra, who was hired to fill her place, joined the Emilia camp as a maid.

In other words, without the tragedy that befell her, Petra would not be where she was today, which made for very complicated feelings――,

???: [Rem… Is that really you?]

It was as if someone had turned over a face-down card, and Petra was double-checking what was on it. One by one, her misunderstandings were replaced with understanding.

Beside her, Emilia called her name in a hesitant voice, blinking her eyes.

Emilia stepped forward and hesitated, opening and closing her lips several times as if searching for the right words,

Emilia: [Umm, sorry, that was a weird thing to say. I've known all along that Rem is Rem… But that's not what I meant to say.]

Rem: [Don't worry, Emilia-sama. Just calm down and take your time. Rem understands that this is all very sudden.]

Emilia: [――. Yes, thank you. But, there's so much I want to say.]

Rem: [But?]

Emilia: […That look suits you reaaally well. It makes you feel like Rem.]

Emilia placed her hand firmly on her chest and smiled at Rem, her amethyst eyes glistening. Rem raised her eyebrows slightly at Emilia's words, then nodded.

She proudly stuck out her chest in her maid uniform and,

Rem: [Nee-sama had this uniform made to suit Rem.]

In response to Rem's answer, Ram crossed her arms and nodded in satisfaction.

???: […What is this all of a sud~den?]

As Emilia and Rem exchanged words, Meili frowned and muttered.

Little crimson scorpions poked out from her hair and clicked their pincers as if worried about their master's reaction. Meili closed one eye and put her hand to her forehead,

Meili: [The moment I saw Ram onee-san's sister, I remembered how she crushed a whole pack of Ulgarm-cha~ns. But that wasn't what caused the job to f~ail…]

Rem: [Then, you should be grateful to Rem. Thanks to Rem, who messed up your job, there were no victims other than Barusu, and you are here now.]

Meili: [I have mixed feelings and am finding it difficult to express my grat~itude…]

Ram pointed this out while clutching her elbow, and Meili made a displeased face and stuck out her tongue.

While Ram's words were harsh, they were also true. In fact, there is no doubt that Meili, who was once an enemy, was accepted into Emilia's camp because her deeds caused minimal damage to the camp. ――Ironically, Ram's point that no victims other than Subaru were harmed was also correct from the perspective of Return by Death.

???: [As one could imagine, the moment we saw Rem, those who had known her before were flooded with memories. Recall. Both Ryuzu-sama and I were unable to contain our emotions. As a result, we were significantly delayed in rejoining everyone. Confession.]

Ram: [Clind's reaction was lacking and unexciting, but Ryuzu-sama's outburst was exaggerated and entertaining. This is a privilege for those who were there.]

Clind: [I see, it was quite a sight. You certainly did see something unusual. Agreement.]

Ram: [――. Ha!]

The revival of her memories among those surrounding Rem. ――No, given the nature of the Authority of Gluttony up until now, it should be called the return of her name.

When Clind touched on that point, she gave Ram a meaningful look, and she clearly looked away in dissatisfaction and laughed.

Upon closer inspection, Ram's slightly reddened eyes and Clind's remark may have been related.

However, Petra did not say anything. ――Not out of a sense of chivalry, but because she was unable to.

Rem: [――Petra-san?]

Suddenly, Rem, who had been the center of attention, saw Petra fall silent and stared at her wide-eyed. Emilia and the others also turned to look at Petra and were startled by her expression.

Their reaction was understandable. Petra, who had not uttered a word up until that point, was now crying profusely from her round eyes and desperately trying to suppress her sobs.

Emilia: [Petra-chan! What's wrong?! Why are you so upset――]

Petra: [――Hk.]

When her tear-strewn face was noticed, Petra pushed off the floor and ran away.

Surprised by Petra's tears, she dodged Emilia's arms as she tried to hug her, avoided Meili who was trying to grab her sleeve, slipped under Rom-jii's legs who was caught off guard by the situation, and with quick movements―― Petra jumped into Rem's chest, who was staring at her with wide eyes.

Then――,

Petra: [Rem――!]

Rem: [Kyaa!]

Rem did not dodge, and instead embraced Petra tightly. Petra tightly embraced Rem's slender body. Petra clung to Rem, reluctant to let go, and Rem blinked her eyes.

Petra: [Rem… Rem, Rem…!]

Rem's reaction left Petra in shambles, unable to stop the tears from flowing. Despite the resolve to never do it in front of others, she found herself sniffling, unable to tear herself away.

Rem looked around for help while she supported a tearful Petra,

Rem: [Um, were Petra-san and Rem really that close that she would cry this much, is it just that there is no memory of it, right…?]

And so, unable to have hidden her confusion, Rem had continued to gently stroke Petra’s head.
